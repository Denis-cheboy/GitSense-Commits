# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 12:31:58 PM
A new Vue component, `AuthSplitLayout.vue`, was introduced on 2/2/2026 at 11:33:11 AM. This component establishes a responsive, split-screen layout for authentication pages, featuring a background image (`list-gun-bg.png`) and a branding logo (`guntrader_logo.svg`). It accepts `title` and `description` props for customization and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

Significant updates were made to the authentication feature tests in `AuthenticationTest.php`. The initial set of tests, recorded on 2/2/2026 at 11:42:16 AM, covered rendering the login screen, successful user authentication with CSRF protection (redirecting to `admin.shops.index`), handling invalid passwords, and user logout. A subsequent update to the same file on 2/2/2026 at 11:49:44 AM refined the successful authentication test by ensuring the test user created was also marked as an `is_admin`, indicating a focus on testing administrative user logins.

Overall, the changes highlight ongoing development in the `GunRegister` project, specifically around user authentication. There's a clear emphasis on establishing a branded and functional login interface, backed by comprehensive feature tests for various authentication scenarios, including a quick refinement to specifically test administrative user access. All documented changes occurred within a short timeframe on the same day, February 2nd, 2026.
