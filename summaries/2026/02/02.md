# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 12:31:58 PM
A new Vue component, `AuthSplitLayout.vue`, was introduced on 2/2/2026 at 11:33:11 AM. This component establishes a responsive, split-screen layout for authentication pages, featuring a background image (`list-gun-bg.png`) and a branding logo (`guntrader_logo.svg`). It accepts `title` and `description` props for customization and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

Significant updates were made to the authentication feature tests in `AuthenticationTest.php`. The initial set of tests, recorded on 2/2/2026 at 11:42:16 AM, covered rendering the login screen, successful user authentication with CSRF protection (redirecting to `admin.shops.index`), handling invalid passwords, and user logout. A subsequent update to the same file on 2/2/2026 at 11:49:44 AM refined the successful authentication test by ensuring the test user created was also marked as an `is_admin`, indicating a focus on testing administrative user logins.

Overall, the changes highlight ongoing development in the `GunRegister` project, specifically around user authentication. There's a clear emphasis on establishing a branded and functional login interface, backed by comprehensive feature tests for various authentication scenarios, including a quick refinement to specifically test administrative user access. All documented changes occurred within a short timeframe on the same day, February 2nd, 2026.

A new Vue layout component, `AuthSplitLayout.vue`, was introduced on 2/2/2026 at 11:33:11 AM. This component provides a split-screen authentication layout, featuring a large background image (`list-gun-bg.png`) on one side and a content area with a logo (`guntrader_logo.svg`), a dynamic title, and description on the other. It uses `defineProps` for `title` and `description` to allow customization.

The `AuthenticationTest.php` file saw several updates on the same date, detailing changes to the authentication feature tests:
*   **2/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM:** Initial version of authentication tests was committed. This included tests for rendering the login screen, successful user authentication with CSRF (redirecting to `admin.shops.index`), failed authentication with invalid passwords, and user logout.
*   **2/2/2026, 11:49:44 AM:** A specific change was made within the `users can authenticate using the login screen with csrf` test. The `User` factory now created a user with `'is_admin' => true` explicitly set, in addition to `must_reset_password => false`.
*   **2/2/2026, 12:58:06 PM:** The modification made at 11:49:44 AM was reverted. The `is_admin => true` flag was removed from the user creation in the `users can authenticate using the login screen with csrf` test, returning the test to its initial state from 11:42:16 AM.

A recurring pattern across the `AuthenticationTest.php` changes is the consistent use of `Str::random(40)` to generate fake CSRF tokens for testing POST requests and the expected redirection to `admin.shops.index` upon successful login, and to `/` upon logout. All changes were logged on February 2, 2026, indicating active development on authentication features.
