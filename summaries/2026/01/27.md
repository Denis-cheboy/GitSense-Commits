The `AdminNavigation.vue` file, last updated on 1/27/2026 at 11:36:21 AM, defines the administrative navigation bar for a "GunRegister" project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\layouts\AdminNavigation.vue`**: This Vue component sets up a navigation bar with a dark theme indicated by its use of `hsl` color values for background, borders, and text. It features:
    *   A primary set of navigation links (`adminNavItems`) for sections like "News", "Shops", "Users", "Reference", "Suppliers", "Police", "Countries", "Documents", "Reports", and "Settings". Each link includes a dynamic icon from `lucide-vue-next`.
    *   A "Weapons" dropdown menu containing sub-links (`weaponsSubmenu`) for "Categories", "Calibres", "Models", "Options", "Gun Adverts", "Advert Users", and "Bulk Edit".
    *   Dynamic styling for navigation items: Active links receive a distinct `border-b-2`, `scale-105` transformation, and specific `hsl` colors for text, border, and background.
    *   Interactive hover effects: Custom `handleMouseEnter` and `handleMouseLeave` methods provide visual feedback (color changes, `scale-105`, `translate-y-0.5`, `shadow-lg`) upon hovering, which are distinct from the active state and do not override active styles.
    *   Complex active state logic: The `isWeaponsActive` computed property groups multiple related routes (e.g., `/admin/weapon`, `/admin/gun-options`, `/admin/gun-list`) to determine if the "Weapons" dropdown should appear active. `isNavItemActive` handles individual link activation, including sub-routes.
    *   The component imports various utilities and components, including `Link` and `usePage` from `@inertiajs/vue3` for routing, `cn` for class name concatenation, and `DropdownMenu` components for the dropdown functionality.
    *   Many navigation `href` attributes utilize a `route()` helper, suggesting integration with a Laravel backend for named routes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Styling Logic:** Both individual navigation items and the "Weapons" dropdown trigger share very similar class structures and dynamic style applications for active and hover states, using `cn` for conditional classes and inline `style` bindings with `hsl` colors.
*   **Icon Usage:** Extensive use of icons from `lucide-vue-next` (e.g., `Building2`, `Users`, `Crosshair`) to visually represent each navigation item's purpose.
*   **Routing Pattern:** The use of `Link` from `@inertiajs/vue3` and `route()` helper for defining navigation links is a consistent pattern across all navigation items, indicating an Inertia.js application.
*   **Dynamic State Management:** `computed` properties (`currentPath`, `isWeaponsActive`) are central to managing the active state of navigation elements based on the current URL.
*   **Event Handling for UI Effects:** The `handleMouseEnter`/`handleMouseLeave` pattern is consistently applied to both individual links and the dropdown trigger for custom hover animations and styling.
