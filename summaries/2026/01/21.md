# Activity Summary for 1/21/2026

## 1:18:49 PM
The provided log details significant updates to the `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\routes\web.php` file, timestamped `1/21/2026, 12:23:22 PM`.

This file primarily defines the application's routing structure, showcasing a comprehensive expansion of backend management functionalities and frontend interactions using Inertia.js.

Key updates and patterns observed include:

*   **Extensive Admin Panel Development**: A large block of routes is nested under an `/admin` prefix, protected by `auth` and `verified` middleware. This section introduces robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and management capabilities for various entities:
    *   **Shops**: Resource routes with a `bulk-update` endpoint.
    *   **Users**: Comprehensive management including index, store, update, withdraw, password reset, onboarding (individual and bulk), and bulk status updates.
    *   **Weapon Categories, Calibres, and Models**: Full CRUD operations for each, along with dedicated routes for `toggle-status`, `bulk-activate`, `bulk-deactivate`, and an `export` function for weapon models.
    *   **Reference Domains & Values**: Routes for managing reference data.
    *   **Gun Options Management**: A complex set of routes for managing gun options, including `index`, `store`, `update`, `approve`, `destroy`, and specialized `merge`, `storeCombo`, and `destroyCombo` operations, often using a `where('value', '.*')` wildcard to handle various option values.
    *   **Gun Advert Editing**: Separate controllers and routes for `bulk-edit` (search, get field values, apply changes) and individual `edit` (get options, create, edit, store, update, destroy, upload image).
*   **Support System Integration**: A `/support` route group allows authenticated and verified users to `index`, `storeTicket`, `updateTicket`, and `storeResponse` to tickets.
*   **FAQ Management**: A `/faq` route group provides full CRUD for FAQs, along with features to `incrementView`, `markHelpful`, `markNotHelpful`, and manage FAQ categories (store, update, destroy).
*   **Legal Compliance Pages**: Dedicated routes under `/legal` for `terms` and `policy` (privacy).
*   **Authentication and Core Application Routes**: The root `/` route renders an `auth/Login` page, and `/dashboard` renders a `Dashboard` page, both using Inertia.js.
*   **Modular Routing**: The file includes external route definitions from `settings.php` and `auth.php`, indicating a modular approach to route management.

Overall, the changes indicate a significant expansion of the `GunRegister` application, particularly in administrative tools for managing inventory data (weapons, gun options, adverts), user accounts, and customer support/information resources. There's a strong emphasis on `bulk` operations and status toggling across multiple entities, suggesting efficiency improvements for administrative tasks.
