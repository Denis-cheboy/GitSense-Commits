# Activity Summary for 1/7/2026

## 11:54:12 AM
The file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\app-version\app-version.controller.ts` was updated on 1/7/2026, 11:35:31 AM. This file defines the `AppVersionController`, a NestJS controller responsible for managing application versions. It includes a mix of public and administrative API endpoints. A key public endpoint `POST /check-update` allows mobile apps to check for available updates, returning information such as the latest version, platform, download URL, and whether the update is compulsory. All other endpoints are administrative, protected by `AuthGuard('jwt')` and `PermissionGuard`, covering operations like creating, retrieving (all or by ID), updating, setting a version as active, and soft-deleting app versions. The controller is extensively documented with Swagger decorators, providing clear API specifications for each endpoint, including summaries, descriptions, request/response structures, and status codes.

The file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\app-version\interfaces\check-update-response.interface.ts` was updated on 1/7/2026, 11:53:12 AM. This file defines the `CheckUpdateResponse` interface, which outlines the data structure returned by the public app update check endpoint. It specifies properties such as `currentVersion`, `platform`, `url`, `isCompulsory`, and optional fields like `updateAvailable` and `releaseNotes`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **App Version Management:** Both files are integral to a system for managing application versions, likely for mobile applications (implied by "mobile app to check for updates" and "platform ios or android").
*   **Public vs. Admin Access:** There's a clear distinction between a single public endpoint for checking updates and multiple administrator-only endpoints for CRUD operations and version activation.
*   **Security Implementation:** Administrative endpoints consistently utilize `AuthGuard('jwt')` and `PermissionGuard`, indicating a robust security layer for privileged operations.
*   **Comprehensive API Documentation:** The `app-version.controller.ts` heavily leverages Swagger decorators (`ApiTags`, `ApiOperation`, `ApiResponse`, `ApiBearerAuth`, `ApiParam`, `ApiQuery`), suggesting a strong focus on clear, self-documenting APIs.
*   **NestJS Framework:** The structure and decorators used throughout the controller are typical of a NestJS application.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** The updates to both files occurred on the same date within minutes of each other, indicating concurrent development efforts on this specific feature module.
