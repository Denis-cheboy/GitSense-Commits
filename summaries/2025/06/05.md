# Activity Summary for 05/06/2025

## 11:21:00
The log shows multiple revisions to three files within the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin` project over a short time period on May 6th, 2025.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue`:  This Vue component, updated at 10:21:00, handles the display and download of payslips.  It includes features for listing payslips, displaying an empty state if no payslips exist, showing a payslip preview (loading indicator included),  and a password verification dialog before accessing payslips.  The component interacts with backend APIs using Axios to fetch and download payslip data.  It uses several Vuetify components and integrates with `bcryptjs` for password hashing and `lodash` for data manipulation.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/package.json`: This file was updated twice, at 10:28:31 and 10:28:47.  Both updates appear to be identical and list the project's dependencies and scripts. The project uses numerous libraries, including many from the `@nathangroup` scope, suggesting a suite of internal components for HR management (attendance, leave, letters, payroll, WFH).  It also uses Vue.js related technologies (Nuxt.js, Vuetify, etc.). The scripts define various build and start commands for development, staging, and production environments (including `dev`, `devMac`, `staging`, `companyConfig`, `production`, and `mcsProduction`).


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/nuxt.config.js`:  This Nuxt.js configuration file underwent several changes between 10:33:22 and 10:34:16, and then a final significant change at 11:03:18.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments and refinements to the configuration, such as removing a commented out `proxy` option in the `axios` configuration and consistently setting `config.devtool` to `false` in the `build` section. The final revision at 11:03:18 involved a more substantial update that includes simplification of the i18n configuration by removing unnecessary comments and  a change in the primary color in the Vuetify theme. The configuration shows the application utilizes Axios for API calls, Vuetify for UI components, and various plugins for features like charting, rich text editing, and more.  The file also defines security headers using the `nuxt-helmet` module and specifies authentication strategy using `@nuxtjs/auth-next` with a refresh token scheme.

In summary, the code changes reflect ongoing development and refinement of a Nuxt.js based HR ERP application. The  `package.json` file shows an extensive list of dependencies, while `nuxt.config.js` reveals several important configurations for security, theming, and API interaction. The  `/payslip.vue` component shows a significant feature focused on employee self-service access to payslips.  The multiple edits in `nuxt.config.js` suggest iterative adjustments, likely in response to testing and debugging.


## 12:13:19
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/password-reset.vue`.  Both revisions, at 05/06/2025 11:13:36 and 05/06/2025 11:53:13, contain identical code for a password reset component. This component uses Vue.js and includes features such as:

* **Password Strength Validation:** The component checks if the new password meets specific criteria (minimum length, number, uppercase, lowercase, and special character).  These checks are implemented using computed properties and regular expressions.
* **Password Matching:** It ensures that the new password and the confirmation password match.  An error message is displayed if they don't.
* **API Interaction:** The `updateUser` method sends a PUT request to the `/users/update/{id}` endpoint to update the user's password using Axios.  It uses a Bearer token from the Vuex store for authentication.  Following a successful update, it fetches updated user information and redirects to `/user/dashboard3`.
* **Vuetify Components:** The component heavily uses Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-form`, `v-text-field`, `v-btn`, `v-alert`, etc.) for its UI.

The second revision (11:53:13) is a duplicate of the first (11:13:36), indicating a possible accidental save or commit.  No actual code changes are present between the two timestamps. There is no other relevant file path to summarize from the provided log.
