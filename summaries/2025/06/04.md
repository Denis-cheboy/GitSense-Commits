# Activity Summary for 04/06/2025

## 12:40:35
The log shows development of a task management API.  Early changes (around 11:41) focused on database connection configuration in `dbCoinnection.js`, initially with an incorrect password, which was subsequently corrected.  The `package.json` file was updated at around 11:42, correcting the `main` script entry.

Between 11:53 and 11:54, the `index.js` (routes file) was modified to improve error handling in the task creation endpoint by adding `console.error` for better debugging.

Significant modifications to the database models (`Task.js` and `SubTask.js`) occurred around 11:58-12:00.  The foreign key in the model associations was changed from `id` to `taskId` for better clarity and accuracy.

Extensive changes were made to `config.json` between 12:14 and 12:22. The file was modified multiple times, primarily adjusting database credentials ("36251972@Deno") and database names, finally settling on "task_management" for all environments (development, test, production) using the "postgres" dialect. There were also some temporary incorrect entries (e.g., "mysql" as the dialect, and a truncated database name).

At 12:18, the `Task.js` model was entirely commented out. Subsequently, it was deleted (12:18:10).

Finally, around 12:27, the `index.js` file (routes) was updated to remove references to the `SubTask` model, implying a potential design change where subtasks are no longer included in the API.  A server file (`server.js`) was added at 12:30, setting up the Express.js server with middleware including CORS and body-parsing for the API.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/task_management/server/routes/index.js` file underwent significant changes throughout the log.  Initially, it contained basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, with an initial version lacking subtask functionality. Around 12:51:02, subtask inclusion was added to the GET `/tasks` route, then removed again later at 12:51:56.  At 12:58:51, a GET route was added to fetch a task by its ID, improving functionality.  The most substantial update occurred at 13:21:34, where authentication middleware (`authMiddleware`) was applied to all routes and significant changes were made to handle user authentication and authorization.  All routes now require authentication and ensure tasks are associated with the authenticated user's ID.  This includes added validation checks (e.g., checking for title, parent task existence, and handling Sequelize validation errors), improved error handling with more informative error messages and 400/404 status codes, and the use of `parseInt` for safer ID handling.  The commented-out `authMiddleware` was removed at 13:36:02, suggesting a final decision to enforce authentication at the route level.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/task_management/server/server.js` file shows the server setup using Express.js, body-parser, and cors.  The initial versions show commented-out authentication routes (`authRouter`).  The final version at 13:36:37 shows the  `/api` route is used to mount the task management routes (`appRouter`), indicating the integration of the updated `index.js` routes.  The server consistently listens on port 3000.  There were no significant changes to the server's core functionality beyond the inclusion of the API routes.
