# Activity Summary for 04/06/2025

## 12:40:35
The log shows development of a task management API.  Early changes (around 11:41) focused on database connection configuration in `dbCoinnection.js`, initially with an incorrect password, which was subsequently corrected.  The `package.json` file was updated at around 11:42, correcting the `main` script entry.

Between 11:53 and 11:54, the `index.js` (routes file) was modified to improve error handling in the task creation endpoint by adding `console.error` for better debugging.

Significant modifications to the database models (`Task.js` and `SubTask.js`) occurred around 11:58-12:00.  The foreign key in the model associations was changed from `id` to `taskId` for better clarity and accuracy.

Extensive changes were made to `config.json` between 12:14 and 12:22. The file was modified multiple times, primarily adjusting database credentials ("36251972@Deno") and database names, finally settling on "task_management" for all environments (development, test, production) using the "postgres" dialect. There were also some temporary incorrect entries (e.g., "mysql" as the dialect, and a truncated database name).

At 12:18, the `Task.js` model was entirely commented out. Subsequently, it was deleted (12:18:10).

Finally, around 12:27, the `index.js` file (routes) was updated to remove references to the `SubTask` model, implying a potential design change where subtasks are no longer included in the API.  A server file (`server.js`) was added at 12:30, setting up the Express.js server with middleware including CORS and body-parsing for the API.
