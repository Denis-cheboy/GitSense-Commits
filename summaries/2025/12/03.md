# Activity Summary for 12/3/2025

## 10:19:16 AM
The `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\database\seeders\DatabaseSeeder.php` file was updated on 12/3/2025, 9:37:30 AM. The primary change within this file involves the `run` method, which is responsible for seeding the application's database. Previously, it appears to have been configured to create 10 random users using `User::factory(10)->create()`, which is now commented out. The current implementation creates a single, specific `User` with the `name` "Test User" and `email` "test@example.com". This indicates a shift from generating multiple random users to setting up a singular, predefined test user.
