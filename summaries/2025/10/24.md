# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 12:12:42 PM
The provided logs indicate significant configuration updates related to the deployment of the `ambulensi-server` application in both development and production environments, primarily through Google Cloud Build YAML files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`cloudbuild-dev.yaml`**: This file, responsible for the development environment's CI/CD pipeline, underwent several rapid modifications between **10/24/2025, 11:35:24 AM** and **10/24/2025, 11:36:38 AM**.
    *   Initially, at **11:35:24 AM**, multiple Google OAuth client IDs (for general, web, Android, and iOS) were added to the `substitutions` section and intended to be echoed into the `secrets.yaml` file. However, the `echo` commands in the script had a recurring error, incorrectly assigning these Google client ID values to `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. Additionally, the `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was empty.
    *   At **11:35:43 AM**, the `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was populated with a concrete value. The `echo` script errors persisted.
    *   Subsequent changes at **11:36:14 AM**, **11:36:30 AM**, and **11:36:38 AM** involved a series of corrections to the `echo` statements within the Cloud Build script. These fixes ensured that the Google OAuth client IDs (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`) were correctly written to `secrets.yaml` with their respective keys, resolving the initial `CELCOM_BASE_URL` misassignments and minor key naming inconsistencies.
    *   A final log entry at **11:46:28 AM** shows no functional change to the file content, possibly indicating a re-save or unrelated metadata update.

*   **`cloudbuild-prod.yaml`**: This file, detailing the production environment's CI/CD, saw updates between **10/24/2025, 11:37:12 AM** and **10/24/2025, 11:37:42 AM**.
    *   At **11:37:12 AM**, the production configuration was established. It included distinct production URLs for `APP_URL`, `SERVER_URL`, GCP bucket names, and Traccar services. It also defined production-specific support emails and introduced Google OAuth client IDs in its substitutions, though `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` were initially empty strings. Unlike the development setup, the `echo` statements in the script for these variables were correctly structured from the start. The Docker image repository and service account were also set to production-specific values.
    *   By **11:37:42 AM**, the `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were populated with their respective values, bringing the production configuration fully in line with the intended Google OAuth setup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Google OAuth Integration**: A prominent pattern is the configuration of Google OAuth client IDs across both development and production environments. The process involved initially adding placeholders or incorrect assignments, followed by rapid corrections to ensure accurate variable mapping.
*   **Environment Variable Management**: Both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` utilize a consistent approach for handling environment variables. Secrets are defined as `_VAR_NAME` substitutions, echoed into a temporary `/workspace/secrets.yaml` file, and then supplied to the Cloud Run deployment using `--env-vars-file`.
*   **SENTRY and Celcom API Configuration**: `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, and Celcom API parameters (`CELCOM_PARTNER_ID`, `CELCOM_SHORTCODE`, `CELCOM_BASE_URL`) are consistently configured across environments as critical application settings.
*   **CI/CD Workflow**: The Cloud Build files consistently define a three-step CI/CD pipeline: fetching secrets, building a Docker image, pushing the image to a container registry (Google Container Registry for dev, Artifact Registry for prod), and deploying to Google Cloud Run.
*   **Environment Specialization**: There's a clear distinction between development and production configurations, especially in URLs, GCP project/bucket IDs, support emails, and the specific Cloud Run service/service account used.
*   **Timestamp Density**: The changes for both configuration files are clustered within a short timeframe (roughly 11:33 AM to 11:46 AM on 10/24/2025), indicating a focused session of environment setup and debugging.

## 1:12:53 PM
The log primarily details changes to Google Cloud Build configurations for both development and production environments, specifically `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml`. These files are responsible for fetching environment variables/secrets, building a Docker image, pushing it to a container registry, and deploying it to Google Cloud Run.

**Key Information from `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-dev.yaml`:**

*   **Initial Configuration (10/24/2025, 11:35:24 AM):** This update introduced a comprehensive set of environment variable substitutions for the development environment. It included settings for `APP_URL`, `SERVER_URL`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_BUCKET_NAME`, `TRACCAR_HOST`, `TRACCAR_SOCKET`, `ZOHO_ORG_ID`, `ZOHO_DEPT_ID`, `ZOHO_CONTACT_ID`, various support emails (e.g., `AMBULENSI_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `EMKF_SUPPORT_EMAIL`), `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CELCOM` API details, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`s. A notable recurring pattern was the appending of these variables to `/workspace/secrets.yaml` for use during deployment. This initial version contained a copy-paste error where `CELCOM_BASE_URL` was mistakenly echoed for multiple Google OAuth client IDs.
*   **Google iOS Client ID Update (10/24/2025, 11:35:43 AM):** The `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was populated with a specific client ID, moving from an empty string. The `echo` syntax error for Google client IDs persisted in this version.
*   **Corrections to Google Client ID Echoing (10/24/2025, 11:36:14 AM - 11:36:38 AM):** A series of rapid updates addressed the `echo` syntax errors for Google OAuth client IDs.
    *   At **11:36:14 AM**, the `echo` for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` was corrected, but a new typo `_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` (extra underscore in the key) was introduced, and `CELCOM_BASE_URL` was still incorrectly used for Android and iOS client IDs.
    *   At **11:36:30 AM**, further corrections were made, fixing `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` in the `echo` statements, but `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` (again, an extra underscore) was still incorrect.
    *   Finally, at **11:36:38 AM**, the `echo` statement for `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` was correctly set.
*   **Minor Re-save (10/24/2025, 11:46:28 AM):** This entry appears to be a re-save as its content is identical to the preceding change, indicating no functional modifications.

**Key Information from `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-prod.yaml`:**

*   **Production Pipeline Setup (10/24/2025, 11:37:12 AM):** This update established the production deployment pipeline. It mirrored the structure of the development build but configured for production environments, including:
    *   Production-specific URLs (e.g., `https://app.ambulensi.org`, `https://server.ambulensi.org`).
    *   Distinct Google Cloud Project ID (`ambulensi-381516`) and GCP bucket names.
    *   Updated support email addresses (`support@ambulensi.org`, `emkf@emkfoundation.org`).
    *   A different Docker image registry path (`europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev`) and Cloud Run service name (`ambulensi-server-prod`) with a dedicated service account.
    *   Initially, `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were empty.
*   **Google Android/iOS Client ID Population (10/24/2025, 11:37:42 AM):** The `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were updated from empty strings to specific client IDs.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cloud Build Standardization:** Both development and production environments utilize Google Cloud Build for CI/CD, following a consistent multi-step process: secret fetching/variable substitution, Docker image building, pushing to a registry, and deploying to Cloud Run.
*   **Environment Parity (with distinctions):** Both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` maintain a largely identical list of environment variables and services, indicating an attempt to keep dev/prod configurations aligned while substituting environment-specific values (URLs, project IDs, emails, client IDs).
*   **Detailed Secret Management:** A strong emphasis is placed on managing sensitive information, with numerous variables (e.g., API keys, client secrets, database URIs, Sentry tokens) being fetched as substitutions and written to a temporary `secrets.yaml` file for deployment.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` changes, particularly for Google OAuth client IDs, show an iterative process of debugging and correcting configuration syntax.
