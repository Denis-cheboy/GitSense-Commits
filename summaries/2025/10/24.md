# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 12:12:42 PM
The provided logs indicate significant configuration updates related to the deployment of the `ambulensi-server` application in both development and production environments, primarily through Google Cloud Build YAML files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`cloudbuild-dev.yaml`**: This file, responsible for the development environment's CI/CD pipeline, underwent several rapid modifications between **10/24/2025, 11:35:24 AM** and **10/24/2025, 11:36:38 AM**.
    *   Initially, at **11:35:24 AM**, multiple Google OAuth client IDs (for general, web, Android, and iOS) were added to the `substitutions` section and intended to be echoed into the `secrets.yaml` file. However, the `echo` commands in the script had a recurring error, incorrectly assigning these Google client ID values to `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. Additionally, the `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was empty.
    *   At **11:35:43 AM**, the `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was populated with a concrete value. The `echo` script errors persisted.
    *   Subsequent changes at **11:36:14 AM**, **11:36:30 AM**, and **11:36:38 AM** involved a series of corrections to the `echo` statements within the Cloud Build script. These fixes ensured that the Google OAuth client IDs (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`) were correctly written to `secrets.yaml` with their respective keys, resolving the initial `CELCOM_BASE_URL` misassignments and minor key naming inconsistencies.
    *   A final log entry at **11:46:28 AM** shows no functional change to the file content, possibly indicating a re-save or unrelated metadata update.

*   **`cloudbuild-prod.yaml`**: This file, detailing the production environment's CI/CD, saw updates between **10/24/2025, 11:37:12 AM** and **10/24/2025, 11:37:42 AM**.
    *   At **11:37:12 AM**, the production configuration was established. It included distinct production URLs for `APP_URL`, `SERVER_URL`, GCP bucket names, and Traccar services. It also defined production-specific support emails and introduced Google OAuth client IDs in its substitutions, though `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` were initially empty strings. Unlike the development setup, the `echo` statements in the script for these variables were correctly structured from the start. The Docker image repository and service account were also set to production-specific values.
    *   By **11:37:42 AM**, the `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were populated with their respective values, bringing the production configuration fully in line with the intended Google OAuth setup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Google OAuth Integration**: A prominent pattern is the configuration of Google OAuth client IDs across both development and production environments. The process involved initially adding placeholders or incorrect assignments, followed by rapid corrections to ensure accurate variable mapping.
*   **Environment Variable Management**: Both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` utilize a consistent approach for handling environment variables. Secrets are defined as `_VAR_NAME` substitutions, echoed into a temporary `/workspace/secrets.yaml` file, and then supplied to the Cloud Run deployment using `--env-vars-file`.
*   **SENTRY and Celcom API Configuration**: `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, and Celcom API parameters (`CELCOM_PARTNER_ID`, `CELCOM_SHORTCODE`, `CELCOM_BASE_URL`) are consistently configured across environments as critical application settings.
*   **CI/CD Workflow**: The Cloud Build files consistently define a three-step CI/CD pipeline: fetching secrets, building a Docker image, pushing the image to a container registry (Google Container Registry for dev, Artifact Registry for prod), and deploying to Google Cloud Run.
*   **Environment Specialization**: There's a clear distinction between development and production configurations, especially in URLs, GCP project/bucket IDs, support emails, and the specific Cloud Run service/service account used.
*   **Timestamp Density**: The changes for both configuration files are clustered within a short timeframe (roughly 11:33 AM to 11:46 AM on 10/24/2025), indicating a focused session of environment setup and debugging.
