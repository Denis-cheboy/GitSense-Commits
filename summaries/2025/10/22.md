# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 11:28:14 AM
There are no non-sensitive code changes to summarize from the provided log. The entry provided is for a `.env.dev` file, which contains environment variables and potentially sensitive keys, and is therefore excluded from the summary.

## 12:28:32 PM
The changes primarily focus on two core areas within the `ambulensi-server` project: push notification functionality and task management, particularly task creation and assignment.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.service.ts`**
*   **Timestamp of significant change:** 10/22/2025, 11:43:27 AM
*   **Updates:** This file introduces a `OneSignalService` responsible for integrating OneSignal push notifications. It leverages the `@onesignal/node-onesignal` library. Key functionalities include:
    *   Sending notifications to specific users (via external IDs), players (via player IDs), or predefined segments.
    *   Sending notifications with custom filters for advanced targeting.
    *   Ability to cancel scheduled notifications and retrieve notification details.
    *   A private `buildNotificationBody` method dynamically constructs the notification payload, supporting various content elements like messages, titles, custom data, images, URLs, and scheduling options.
    *   The service incorporates robust error logging using NestJS's `Logger`.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\services\task-create\task-create.service.ts`**
*   **Timestamps of significant changes:** Multiple, ranging from 10/22/2025, 12:18:44 PM to 10/22/2025, 12:27:45 PM. These indicate an active period of development and refinement for this service.
*   **Updates:** This service manages the creation of new tasks, with a distinction between general tasks and incident-related tasks that involve auto-assignment.
    *   **Task Identification:** It includes a `generateTaskId` method that creates unique, date-prefixed task IDs (e.g., `TASK-YYYYMMDD-####`), ensuring sequential numbering and allowing for easy identification.
    *   **Data Validation:** Strong validation checks are in place for MongoDB `ObjectId`s for fields like `createdBy`, `ambulanceId`, `assignedDriver`, and `assignedEMT`, raising `BadRequestException` for invalid inputs.
    *   **Transactional Operations:** Task creation and assignment operations are wrapped in MongoDB transactions (`session.withTransaction`) to ensure atomicity and data consistency.
    *   **Task Types:** The service distinguishes between regular task creation and incident-based task creation (`isIncidentTaskCreation`), which implies different processing or data requirements. Incident tasks include additional properties like `class`, `category`, and `priority`.
    *   **Dependencies:** It injects `TaskAssignService` to handle the assignment logic after a task document is created.
    *   **Dependency Addition & Usage Pattern:** Over the series of changes, `IncidentService` was progressively added to the constructor and then used within the `handleRegularTaskCreation` method to retrieve incident details (`await this.incidentService.findOne(params.incidentId)`).
    *   **Refactoring:** A subtle but notable change occurred at 12:27:45 PM in the `handleRegularTaskCreation` method, where the `taskAssignService.assignTask` call's third argument was changed from `params` to an empty object `{}`, suggesting a refinement in how assignment-specific parameters are passed or handled for regular tasks.
    *   **Default Status:** Newly created tasks (both regular and incident-based) are initialized with `TaskStatus.ASSIGNED`.
    *   Extensive logging is present to track the progress and potential errors during task creation and assignment.

**Overall Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
*   **Modular Architecture:** The system uses a service-oriented approach (`OneSignalService`, `TaskCreateService`, `TaskAssignService`, `IncidentService`) indicative of a well-structured application, likely using a framework like NestJS.
*   **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** Both services utilize a `Logger` for detailed logging and implement try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully, typically throwing custom exceptions (`InternalServerErrorException`, `BadRequestException`).
*   **Database Transactions:** The use of MongoDB transactions in the `TaskCreateService` highlights a commitment to data integrity for critical operations involving multiple document modifications.
*   **Focus on Specific Domain Logic:** The changes reflect development around core ambulance dispatch/management features, specifically notification delivery and the lifecycle of incident-driven tasks.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of small changes to `task-create.service.ts` indicates active and incremental development or debugging on this specific feature.
