# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 10:07:56 AM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on environment configuration and continuous deployment pipelines for an "ambulensi-server" project, occurring on October 24, 2025.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\.env.dev`**: This development environment file was updated multiple times between 11:33 AM and 12:56 PM. The changes involved populating specific configuration values related to Google iOS client ID and Apple Team ID. Due to the sensitive nature of this file, no further details on its content changes are provided.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-dev.yaml`**: This Google Cloud Build configuration for the development environment underwent several modifications between 11:35 AM and 11:46 AM.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:35:24 AM)**: The file outlined a standard CI/CD pipeline, including steps to fetch secrets from Secret Manager, build a Docker image with Sentry DSN and Auth Token as build arguments, push the image to Google Container Registry, and deploy it to a Cloud Run service named `ambulensi-server-dev` in the `europe-west1` region. It defined a comprehensive list of environment variable substitutions, covering application URLs, GCP resources, Traccar integration, Zoho details, various support emails, Celcom API settings, and Google OAuth client IDs. Notably, several `echo` commands for Google OAuth client IDs were initially incorrectly configured, repeating `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. The `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was initially empty.
    *   **Google OAuth ID Population (11:35:43 AM)**: The `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was updated with a specific ID.
    *   **Syntax Corrections (11:36:14 AM - 11:36:38 AM)**: A rapid series of commits addressed and corrected the syntax errors in the `bash` script within the "Fetch secrets from Secret Manager" step. Specifically, the `echo` commands for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` were progressively fixed to correctly write their respective variable names to `/workspace/secrets.yaml` instead of `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. The final correction was made at 11:36:38 AM.
    *   **Minor Re-save (11:46:28 AM)**: No functional changes were observed in the last recorded update for this file compared to the immediate preceding version.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-prod.yaml`**: This Google Cloud Build configuration for the production environment also saw updates.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:37:12 AM)**: Similar to the dev configuration, it defined steps for fetching secrets, building, pushing, and deploying a Docker image to `ambulensi-server-prod`. It used production-specific URLs, a different GCP project ID (`ambulensi-381516`), and a distinct service account. Initially, `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were empty.
    *   **Google OAuth ID Population (11:37:42 AM)**: Both `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were populated with specific IDs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 11:33 AM**: Initial changes to the development environment file (`.env.dev`).
*   **10/24/2025, 11:35 AM - 11:37 AM**: A concentrated period of updates and corrections to both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` files, specifically around Google OAuth configurations and the CI/CD pipeline's secret handling.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:56 PM**: A later update to the development environment file, indicating ongoing configuration adjustments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cloud Build Pipeline Consistency**: Both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` follow a consistent pattern: fetching secrets, building a Docker image, pushing it to a registry, and deploying to Google Cloud Run.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration**: There is a clear separation of configurations for development and production environments, using distinct URLs, GCP project IDs, bucket names, and service accounts.
*   **Extensive Use of Environment Variables/Substitutions**: A large number of variables are configured across both `.env.dev` and the Cloud Build `substitutions` block, indicating a dependency on external services and APIs (GCP, Traccar, Zoho, SendGrid, Sentry, Celcom, Google Maps, Google OAuth, Apple Sign In, OneSignal).
*   **Frequent Google OAuth & Apple Sign In Adjustments**: Updates consistently involve Google OAuth client IDs and Apple Sign In details, suggesting active integration or refinement of these authentication methods.
*   **Error Correction in Pipeline Scripts**: A series of quick fixes in `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` highlights iterative development and debugging of the CI/CD script, specifically concerning how Google OAuth client IDs were being passed to the deployed service.

## 11:54:09 AM
The logs show a focused effort on integrating and refining social authentication features, particularly for Apple Sign-In, within the `ambulensi-server` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**:
    *   **Initial Setup and Refinements (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 11:32:28 AM):** This service was introduced or significantly updated to handle Apple ID token verification. Key changes included adding a `serviceId` property, derived from `APPLE_SERVICE_ID` in configuration, alongside the existing `clientId` (from `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`). The initial commit at 11:32:07 AM declared `serviceId` within the constructor but it was formalized as a private class property by 11:32:28 AM.
    *   **Configuration Validation (10/27/2025, 11:33:18 AM):** A crucial enhancement was added to the constructor to validate the presence of `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `APPLE_SERVICE_ID`. If either is missing, it now logs an error and throws an `Error` indicating incomplete Apple Sign-In configuration, preventing the service from operating incorrectly.
    *   **Method Visibility Adjustments (10/27/2025, 11:38:16 AM - 11:38:24 AM):** The `extractEmailFromToken` method initially had implicit public access. It was briefly changed to `private` at 11:38:16 AM, and then reverted back to its original public accessibility at 11:38:24 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.module.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:15 AM)**:
    *   This file defines the `SocialAuthModule`, responsible for organizing social authentication components. It imports necessary NestJS modules like `ConfigModule` and `PassportModule`, along with application-specific `UserModule` and `TokenGenerationModule`. The module registers `SocialAuthController` and a suite of providers: `SocialAuthService`, `AppleTokenVerifierService`, `GoogleTokenVerifierService`, and `GoogleUserInfoService`, making them available for dependency injection within the social authentication context.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:29 AM)**:
    *   This service acts as the central orchestrator for social logins. It now contains `handleGoogleTokenAuth` and `handleAppleSignIn` methods. The `handleAppleSignIn` method shows detailed logic for processing Apple Sign-In requests, including verifying the ID token, handling `nonce` verification, and extracting user details like email, first name, last name, and private email status, with robust fallback mechanisms for missing data. A private `processUserAuthentication` method encapsulates common logic for finding or creating users, updating their status (e.g., `UserStatus.active`, `isVerified`), marking first logins, and generating authentication tokens.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM:** Initial implementation or major update of `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`, setting up core Apple token verification.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:33:18 AM:** Introduction of configuration validation logic in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`, enhancing stability.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:42:15 AM:** Formal definition of `social-auth.module.ts`, structuring the social authentication feature.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:42:29 AM:** Implementation of `social-auth.service.ts`, providing the business logic for Google and Apple social logins.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Social Authentication Focus:** The changes predominantly revolve around integrating and solidifying social login capabilities, specifically for Apple and Google, within the application.
*   **Modularity and Dependency Injection:** The code utilizes NestJS's modular structure and dependency injection heavily, with dedicated modules and services for specific functionalities (e.g., token verification, user management).
*   **Configuration-Driven Development:** Services are configured via `ConfigService`, retrieving values like `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `APPLE_SERVICE_ID`, indicating a flexible, environment-aware setup.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Extensive use of `Logger` for debugging and error reporting, coupled with `UnauthorizedException` for failed authentication attempts, highlights a focus on application stability and diagnosability.
*   **Token-Based Authentication:** The process consistently involves verifying ID tokens from social providers, extracting user payloads, and then generating application-specific access tokens.
*   **User Provisioning and Updates:** A common flow involves checking if a user exists based on their social profile, creating them if new, and updating their status and login timestamps for existing users.

## 12:53:58 PM
The provided log details changes exclusively within the file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\social-logins\src\App.jsx`.

**Key Information and File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Initial Implementation (10/27/2025, 12:33:38 PM - 12:33:43 PM):** The `App.jsx` file initially contained commented-out code for Google OAuth authentication. The active code implemented a basic Apple Sign-In using the `react-apple-signin-auth` library. It included a `handleSuccess` function that would send the `idToken` to a backend endpoint `http://localhost:4000/auth/apple`. Placeholder values were used for `clientId` ("YOUR_SERVICE_ID") and `redirectURI` ("https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback").

*   **Major Refactor and UI Enhancement (10/27/2025, 12:40:34 PM):** This timestamp marks a significant overhaul.
    *   **State Management:** React's `useState` hooks were introduced to manage `loading`, `result`, and `error` states, providing dynamic feedback to the user.
    *   **Enhanced Apple Sign-In Logic:** The `handleSuccess` function was refactored to use `async/await` for better handling of the backend API call. It now extracts more user information (`email`, `firstName`, `lastName`) from the Apple response and sends it to the backend endpoint `http://localhost:4000/social-auth/apple/verify`. Robust error handling with `try...catch...finally` was added.
    *   **User Interface:** A complete styled UI for the Apple Sign-In process was introduced. This includes a dedicated container, card, title, subtitle, and a custom-rendered Apple Sign-In button with loading indication.
    *   **Status Display:** Sections for displaying loading, success (with JSON result), and error messages were added, enhancing the user experience for testing the integration.
    *   **Styling:** A comprehensive `styles` object was defined within the component for all visual elements.
    *   **AppleIcon Component:** A small SVG component for the Apple logo was added.
    *   **Configuration Updates:** The `clientId` in `authOptions` was updated from "YOUR_SERVICE_ID" to "org.ambulensi.mobile.service". The `redirectURI` was set to "http://localhost:3000".
    *   **Setup Instructions:** A dedicated section outlining setup instructions for developers was added to the UI.

*   **Subsequent `redirectURI` Adjustments (10/27/2025, 12:45:19 PM - 12:52:02 PM):** Following the major refactor, the subsequent changes primarily involved modifications to the `redirectURI` within the `AppleSignin` component's `authOptions`:
    *   **12:45:19 PM:** No effective change from the previous entry.
    *   **12:48:51 PM:** `redirectURI` changed to "https://api.yourcompany.com/au".
    *   **12:49:02 PM:** `redirectURI` reverted back to "http://localhost:3000".
    *   **12:49:30 PM:** `redirectURI` changed to "dev.app.ambulensi.org" (a likely incomplete URI, missing protocol).
    *   **12:51:52 PM:** `redirectURI` modified to "http//dev.app.ambulensi.org" (a typo, `http//` instead of `http://`).
    *   **12:52:02 PM:** `redirectURI` corrected to "https://dev.app.ambulensi.org".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Focus:** All changes are concentrated on a single file, `App.jsx`, indicating a focused development effort on the main application component for social logins.
*   **Shift from Google to Apple:** The commented-out Google OAuth code remains untouched throughout, while the Apple Sign-In implementation is actively developed and refined. This suggests a primary focus on Apple integration.
*   **Iterative Configuration:** The `redirectURI` is a frequently adjusted parameter, changing multiple times within a short period. This pattern indicates ongoing configuration testing or environment-specific adjustments for the Apple Sign-In setup.
*   **Backend Interaction:** The application consistently attempts to send authentication data to a backend running on `http://localhost:4000`, specifically to an endpoint like `/auth/apple` or `/social-auth/apple/verify`, demonstrating a client-server architecture for social authentication.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** After the initial basic setup, there's a clear move towards a more robust and user-friendly interface with loading indicators, success/error messages, and clear instructions, reflecting best practices for authentication flows.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Enhanced Apple Sign-In Security and Robustness**: The majority of changes focus on making Apple Sign-In more secure and adaptable, particularly by ensuring correct configuration and validating tokens based on the originating platform.
*   **Centralization of Logic**: New private helper methods (`parseBoolean`, `buildFullName`, `getAudienceForPlatform`) were introduced to encapsulate specific logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code within the services.
*   **Dependency Management**: Minor adjustments to `jwks-client` import demonstrate ongoing refinement of external library usage.
*   **Configuration as Constants**: Moving magic values like cache ages into constants (`JWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE`) improves readability and manageability.
*   **Type Safety**: Explicitly typing `jwksClient` and defining the `Platform` enum underscore a focus on type safety in the TypeScript codebase.

## 2:53:09 PM
The provided log details a series of changes to a single file, `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\social-logins\src\App.jsx`, over a period on October 27, 2025.

**File-specific Updates for `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\social-logins\src\App.jsx`:**

*   **Initial State (10/27/2025, 12:33:38 PM):** The file contained a commented-out Google OAuth login implementation. The active code was a basic React component (`App`) using `react-apple-signin-auth`. It had placeholder values for `clientId` ("YOUR_SERVICE_ID"), `scope` ("email name"), and `redirectURI` (`https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback`) for Apple Sign-In, and sent the `idToken` to `http://localhost:4000/auth/apple`.
*   **Major Refactor and UI Enhancement (10/27/2025, 12:40:34 PM):** This was the most significant change.
    *   State management was introduced with `useState` hooks for `loading`, `result`, and `error`.
    *   The `handleSuccess` function was updated to use `async/await`, perform more detailed logging, and send user data (email, first name, last name from `response.user`) along with the `idToken` to the backend.
    *   The backend endpoint for Apple verification changed to `http://localhost:4000/social-auth/apple/verify`.
    *   The `AppleSignin` component's `authOptions` were updated: `clientId` was set to `"org.ambulensi.mobile.service"`, `redirectURI` initially changed to `"http://localhost:3000"`, `state` became dynamically generated, and `nonce` was removed.
    *   The component's render logic was vastly expanded to include a full UI layout with status boxes for loading, success, and error, using inline styles defined in a `styles` object. A custom `AppleIcon` SVG component was also added.
    *   Setup instructions were embedded directly into the UI.
*   **Redirect URI Iterations (10/27/2025, 12:48:51 PM - 1:04:27 PM):** There were frequent, almost minute-by-minute, changes and corrections to the `redirectURI` within the `AppleSignin`'s `authOptions`. This included:
    *   `https://api.yourcompany.com/au`
    *   `http://localhost:3000` (revert)
    *   `dev.app.ambulensi.org` (likely an incomplete URL)
    *   `http//dev.app.ambulensi.org` (typo)
    *   `https://dev.app.ambulensi.org` (correction)
    *   `https://dev.app.ambulensi.org/auth/apple/callback`
    *   `https://dev.app.ambulensi.org` (revert)
    *   `dev.app.ambulensi.org` (revert to incomplete)
    *   `https://api.ambulensi.org`
    *   `https://api.ambulensi.org/auth/app`
    *   Finally settling on `https://api.ambulensi.org/auth/apple/callback` (1:04:27 PM).
*   **Backend Endpoint Host Change (10/27/2025, 12:56:31 PM):** The `fetch` call's target backend port was changed from `localhost:4000` to `localhost:3000`. However, the embedded "Setup Instructions" in the UI incorrectly continued to state "Make sure backend is running on port 4000".
*   **Backend Payload Addition (10/27/2025, 1:30:37 PM):** The `platform: "android"` field was added to the JSON payload sent to the backend for Apple verification, despite a comment indicating platform detection was automatic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 12:33:38 PM:** Initial Apple Sign-In implementation with placeholders.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:40:34 PM:** Major overhaul to include robust state management, enhanced UI, and more comprehensive data submission for Apple Sign-In. The `clientId` was set to `"org.ambulensi.mobile.service"`.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:56:31 PM:** Change in the backend fetch URL's port from 4000 to 3000.
*   **10/27/2025, 1:04:27 PM:** Final adjustment of `redirectURI` to `https://api.ambulensi.org/auth/apple/callback` after multiple iterations.
*   **10/27/2025, 1:30:37 PM:** Addition of `platform: "android"` to the backend payload.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Shift from Google to Apple:** The initial log entries show a transition from a commented-out Google OAuth setup to an active and evolving Apple Sign-In integration.
*   **Iterative Configuration:** There's a clear pattern of frequent, small adjustments to configuration values, particularly the `redirectURI` and backend endpoint, suggesting active development, testing, and debugging of the Apple Sign-In flow.
*   **UI Focus:** After the initial basic setup, a significant effort was made to create a detailed user interface for testing and displaying the results of the Apple Sign-In process, including loading, success, and error states.
*   **Static Client ID:** Once set at 12:40:34 PM, the `clientId` for Apple Sign-In (`"org.ambulensi.mobile.service"`) remained constant, unlike the `redirectURI`.
*   **Inconsistent Instructions:** The "Setup Instructions" within the component's UI were not always updated to reflect the latest code changes (e.g., backend port).

## 2:53:24 PM
`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`
This file, responsible for verifying Apple ID tokens, underwent substantial development on **October 27, 2025**. Initially, it established the basic token verification flow. Significant updates include:
*   Between **11:32 AM** and **11:33 AM**, the service was enhanced to explicitly retrieve `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `APPLE_SERVICE_ID` from the configuration and added validation to ensure their presence, preventing incomplete Apple Sign-In configurations.
*   Around **11:55 AM**, the `jwksClient` import statement was adjusted multiple times, eventually standardizing to `import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';` with an explicit type `jwksClient.JwksClient` by **11:56 AM**.
*   The `jwksClient` cache duration was made configurable by introducing `JWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` from a separate constants file around **11:57 AM**.
*   A major feature enhancement for platform-specific audience validation was implemented between **12:06 PM** and **12:09 PM**. This involved modifying the `verifyIdToken` method to accept a `platform` parameter (type `'ios' | 'android'`) and adding a `private getAudienceForPlatform` helper method to dynamically set the JWT audience based on whether it's an iOS (using `clientId`) or Android (using `serviceId`) request.
*   A `private parseBoolean` helper was introduced around **12:14 PM** to handle robust boolean conversion from various input types.
*   Minor refactoring for import styles (e.g., `crypto`) was also observed.

`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.module.ts`
On **October 27, 2025, at 11:42:15 AM**, this module was initially defined. It aggregates configuration, passport authentication, user management, and token generation modules. It registers `SocialAuthController` and provides `SocialAuthService`, `AppleTokenVerifierService`, `GoogleTokenVerifierService`, and `GoogleUserInfoService`, making `SocialAuthService` exportable.

`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`
This central social authentication service received several updates on **October 27, 2025**:
*   The `handleAppleSignIn` method was updated at **12:10:00 PM** to pass the `platform` information to the `appleTokenVerifier.verifyIdToken` call, enabling platform-specific validation.
*   To improve code quality, a `private parseBoolean` helper method was introduced at **12:15:43 PM** to standardize the conversion of string/boolean values for `emailVerified` and `isPrivateEmail`.
*   A `private buildFullName` helper method was added at **12:17:37 PM** to encapsulate the logic for constructing a user's full name, and the `handleAppleSignIn` method was refactored at **12:18:23 PM** to utilize this helper.
*   A debug `console.log` was added to `processUserAuthentication` at **12:57:53 PM**.

`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\constants\social-auth.constants.ts`
This file was created on **October 27, 2025**, specifically at **11:57:18 AM**, to house various constants related to social authentication, including `JWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` (set to 24 hours), `JWKS_RATE_LIMIT`, `CLIENT_SECRET_EXPIRY`, and URIs/Issuers for Google and Apple authentication. A minor typo was corrected shortly after at **11:57:41 AM**.

`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`
Created on **October 27, 2025**, this file defines the `AppleSignInDto` for Apple Sign-In requests. Initially, at **12:10:40 PM**, it included fields for the ID token, authorization code, user names, email, full name, and nonce. A `platform` property was also present but referenced an undefined `Platform` enum. This enum was subsequently defined within the same file at **12:10:54 AM**, resolving the type definition.

`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\index.ts`
This file was introduced on **October 27, 2025, at 12:27:09 PM**. Its sole function is to re-export `apple-token-verifier.service`, simplifying imports from the `apple` providers directory.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
All significant changes occurred on **October 27, 2025**, indicating a concentrated effort to develop and refine the social authentication features. The primary focus was on enhancing Apple Sign-In, particularly by introducing platform-specific validation logic and improving data parsing through new helper methods. There were recurring minor adjustments to import statements for external libraries (`jwks-rsa`, `crypto`), suggesting iterative code refinement. The introduction of specific DTOs and constants files demonstrates a commitment to modularity and clear separation of concerns in the codebase.

## 3:53:09 PM
For the file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\social-logins\src\App.jsx`:

The changes in this file primarily revolve around integrating and refining Apple Sign-In functionality, replacing a previously commented-out Google OAuth implementation.

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Initial Setup (10/27/2025, 12:33:38 PM):** The file was configured for basic Apple Sign-In using the `react-apple-signin-auth` library. It had a placeholder `clientId` ("YOUR_SERVICE_ID") and a generic `redirectURI` ("https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback"). The `handleSuccess` function performed a `POST` request to `http://localhost:4000/auth/apple`. The previous Google OAuth code was commented out.
*   **Major Refactor and UI Enhancement (10/27/2025, 12:40:34 PM):** This timestamp marks a significant overhaul.
    *   React `useState` hooks were introduced to manage loading, result, and error states, significantly improving the user experience during the sign-in flow.
    *   The `handleSuccess` function was updated to be `async`, extract more user data (email, first name, last name) from the Apple response, and send this comprehensive data to the backend endpoint `http://localhost:4000/social-auth/apple/verify`.
    *   The `AppleSignin` component's `authOptions` were updated: `clientId` was set to `"org.ambulensi.mobile.service"`, and `redirectURI` was changed to `"http://localhost:3000"`.
    *   A custom render prop was added to the `AppleSignin` component to display a styled "Sign in with Apple" button, including a loading indicator and an SVG Apple icon.
    *   Extensive styling (defined in a `styles` object) and informational UI elements (loading/success/error boxes, setup instructions) were added, transforming the component into a functional test page for Apple Sign-In.
*   **Frequent `redirectURI` Adjustments (10/27/2025, 12:48:51 PM - 1:04:27 PM):** Over a period of about 15 minutes, the `redirectURI` within the `AppleSignin` component's `authOptions` was iteratively changed multiple times. This includes variations like `"https://api.yourcompany.com/au"`, `"http://localhost:3000"`, `"dev.app.ambulensi.org"`, a corrected `"https://dev.app.ambulensi.org"`, `"https://dev.app.ambulensi.org/auth/apple/callback"`, `"https://api.ambulensi.org"`, and `"https://api.ambulensi.org/auth/app"`, eventually settling on `"https://api.ambulensi.org/auth/apple/callback"` in the later logs.
*   **Backend Endpoint Change (10/27/2025, 12:56:31 PM):** The target URL for the backend authentication `fetch` request was changed from `http://localhost:4000/social-auth/apple/verify` to `http://localhost:3000/social-auth/apple/verify`.
*   **Minor Backend Request Body Addition (10/27/2025, 1:30:37 PM):** The `platform: "android"` field was added to the JSON body sent to the backend during authentication, despite a comment suggesting the backend auto-detects this.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 12:33:38 PM:** Initial Apple Sign-In integration.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:40:34 PM:** Major functional and UI enhancement for Apple Sign-In.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:56:31 PM:** Change in the backend authentication port (from 4000 to 3000).
*   **10/27/2025, 1:30:37 PM:** Addition of `platform` field to the backend request body.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative `redirectURI` Adjustments:** The `redirectURI` in the `AppleSignin` `authOptions` was frequently modified and tested, suggesting active configuration or troubleshooting of the Apple Developer Console settings for different environments (localhost, dev, production API).
*   **Consistent `clientId`:** After the initial update, the `clientId` for Apple Sign-In remained `"org.ambulensi.mobile.service"` across all subsequent changes, indicating a fixed service ID.
*   **Google OAuth Code is Commented Out:** The Google OAuth provider and login components remained commented out throughout the entire log, indicating a shift in focus to Apple Sign-In.
*   **Backend Verification Pattern:** The core logic of sending the `idToken` and user details to a backend endpoint for verification remained consistent, only the endpoint details and payload content evolved.

## 3:53:30 PM
Changes were observed across several files, primarily focusing on enhancing Apple Sign-In functionality, refining deployment configurations, and managing database records. All recorded modifications occurred on October 27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\.env.dev` (10/27/2025, 10:55:52 AM - 11:14:00 AM):** This environment configuration file was updated multiple times. These changes likely involved modifications to Apple Sign-In related keys and other service credentials.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 12:32:15 PM):**
    *   Initial changes involved declaring and initializing `serviceId` in the constructor (11:32:28 AM) and adding a check to ensure `clientId` and `serviceId` are configured, throwing an error if missing (11:33:18 AM).
    *   The `extractEmailFromToken` method's visibility was changed from public to private (11:38:16 AM).
    *   A significant correction was made by updating the `jwksClient` import from the incorrect `jwks-client` to `jwks-rsa` (11:55:04 AM) and then explicitly typing `jwksClient` as `jwksClient.JwksClient` (11:56:00 AM).
    *   The `jwksClient` cache expiration was updated to use a constant `JWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` (11:57:07 AM), which was then imported (11:58:08 AM).
    *   The `verifyIdToken` method was modified to accept a `platform` parameter, and a new private `getAudienceForPlatform` helper method was introduced. This allows the token verification to use `clientId` for iOS and `serviceId` for Android as the audience, addressing platform-specific Apple Sign-In requirements (multiple changes between 12:06:56 PM and 12:09:27 PM).
    *   A private helper method `parseBoolean` was added to standardize the parsing of string/boolean values for token payload properties like `email_verified` and `is_private_email` (12:14:42 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.module.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:15 AM):** The module continues to import and provide `AppleTokenVerifierService`, `GoogleTokenVerifierService`, and `GoogleUserInfoService`, `TokenGenerationModule`, indicating a consistent structure for social authentication.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:29 AM - 12:57:53 PM):**
    *   The `handleAppleSignIn` method was updated to pass the new `platform` and `nonce` parameters to the `appleTokenVerifier.verifyIdToken` method (12:10:00 PM).
    *   It adopted the new `parseBoolean` helper from `apple-token-verifier.service.ts` for handling `email_verified` and `is_private_email` fields from the Apple token payload (12:15:43 PM).
    *   A private helper method `buildFullName` was introduced to encapsulate the logic for constructing a user's full name from `firstName`, `lastName`, or an existing `fullName` field in the DTO (12:17:37 PM, 12:18:23 PM).
    *   A `console.log` statement was added for debugging purposes within `processUserAuthentication` (12:57:53 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\constants\social-auth.constants.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:57:18 AM - 11:57:41 AM):**
    *   Introduced `JWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` with a value of 24 hours in milliseconds and `APPLE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`.
    *   A small typo (`caJWKS_CACHE_MAX_AGE`) was immediately corrected.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts` (10/27/2025, 12:10:40 PM - 12:11:28 PM):**
    *   The `AppleSignInDto` was updated to include a mandatory `platform` field (an enum) and an optional `nonce` string for Apple Sign-In.
    *   The `Platform` enum (`IOS`, `ANDROID`) was explicitly defined within the file (12:10:54 AM).
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\index.ts` (10/27/2025, 12:27:09 PM):** This file was updated to export `apple-token-verifier.service`, maintaining modularity.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-dev.yaml` (10/27/2025, 1:33:57 PM - 1:36:46 PM):** This Google Cloud Build configuration for the development environment saw continuous updates. Initially, many new environment variables related to support emails (`_AMBULENSI_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `_EMKF_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `_EMKF_ICT_EMAIL`, `_GRAVITY_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `_GRAVITY_ADMIN_EMAIL`), `_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_HOURS`, Celcom API details (`_CELCOM_PARTNER_ID`, `_CELCOM_SHORTCODE`, `_CELCOM_BASE_URL`), and Google client IDs were added. Subsequent changes focused on adding and correctly configuring `_APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `_APPLE_SERVICE_ID` substitutions for Apple Sign-In integration into the deployment process. There were several iterative corrections to ensure these variables were properly echoed into the `secrets.yaml` file for the deployment.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-prod.yaml` (10/27/2025, 1:37:43 PM - 1:38:30 PM):** Similar to the development Cloud Build file, the production configuration was updated to include new environment variables for support emails, token expiration, Celcom API, Google client IDs, and specifically `_APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `_APPLE_SERVICE_ID`. The Docker image registry path was updated to use `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev`. These changes reflect the process of aligning production environment variables with the newly introduced features.
*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\Full Gun records for a client.md` (10/27/2025, 3:22:41 PM - 3:24:01 PM):** This Markdown document contains a collection of SQL queries related to 'gun' records, including counts, retrieval of sold items older than 6 years, and archival/deletion operations. It also outlines the importance of these queries for risk assessment, client communication, phased data management, and business intelligence. A minor change involved correcting an HTML entity `&nbsp;` to a regular space in one of the SQL queries (3:24:01 PM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes reveal a clear focus on implementing and refining social authentication, particularly for Apple Sign-In. This involved:
1.  **Configuration Management:** Extensive updates to Cloud Build YAML files and environment variables (`.env.dev`) to support new services and social login providers (Google, Apple, Celcom, Sentry). This suggests an ongoing effort to integrate and manage various external dependencies and secrets across different deployment environments.
2.  **Apple Sign-In Feature Development:** A concentrated effort was made to robustly implement Apple Sign-In, including:
    *   Handling different client IDs (`clientId` for iOS, `serviceId` for Android/Web) in token verification.
    *   Implementing nonce verification for enhanced security.
    *   Adding comprehensive validation and parsing logic for token payloads, including helper functions for boolean and full name processing.
    *   Ensuring error handling and logging for failed verifications.
3.  **Code Quality & Refactoring:** Introduction of helper methods (e.g., `parseBoolean`, `buildFullName`, `getAudienceForPlatform`) and dependency corrections (`jwks-client` to `jwks-rsa`) indicate an emphasis on cleaner code, maintainability, and correct external library usage.
4.  **Database Management & Analytics:** The SQL queries in the Markdown file highlight routine database maintenance tasks (archiving/deleting old records) and data analysis for operational insights and client communication.

The consistent timestamp (October 27, 2025) across all file changes indicates a dedicated development session or a consolidated commit related to these system updates and feature additions.

## 9:03:54 PM
The logged changes primarily involve updates to the application's routing configuration and a Vue.js component for managing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\routes\web.php`**: This file, responsible for defining the application's web routes, underwent a key addition. Initially, it established core routes for authentication, dashboard, admin (shops), support, and FAQ sections. The most significant update was at **10/27/2025, 6:25:37 PM**, where **administrative routes for user management (`/admin/users`) were introduced**, specifically adding a GET route to display all users (`users.index`) handled by `UserController`. Previous entries for this file were identical, indicating no changes between 6:25:02 PM and 6:25:10 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\admin\FAQAddDialog.vue`**: This Vue component, designed for adding new FAQs, saw several rapid iterations.
    *   At **10/27/2025, 6:31:53 PM**, the component was introduced, providing a dialog with form fields for category, question, and answer. It includes client-side validation, character counters, a list of predefined FAQ categories with icons, and uses a `useToast` composable for user feedback. It had an initial issue where the `defineProps` line was commented out.
    *   Subsequent changes at **10/27/2025, 6:33:30 PM**, **6:33:45 PM**, and **6:33:53 PM** were focused on **correcting how component props (specifically the `open` prop for controlling dialog visibility) were declared and accessed**. This involved uncommenting `defineProps`, attempting to destructure `open` incorrectly, and finally correcting the template to use `props.open` correctly.
    *   A minor refinement was made at **10/27/2025, 6:53:46 PM**, where the error parameter `(error)` was removed from the `catch` block in the `handleSave` function, making the error handling more generic.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\pages\vue-shim.d.ts`**: This file, first logged at **10/27/2025, 6:51:08 PM**, provides a TypeScript declaration for `.vue` files, essential for TypeScript to correctly interpret Vue Single File Components (SFCs) within the project. It shows a standard configuration for a Vue 3 TypeScript setup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Laravel/Inertia/Vue 3 Stack:** The project structure and code snippets indicate a consistent use of Laravel for the backend, Inertia.js for connecting the backend with the frontend, and Vue 3 for building the user interface.
*   **Admin Functionality Focus:** Both the route changes (adding admin user routes) and the development of the `FAQAddDialog.vue` component point towards an active development of administrative features within the application.
*   **Component-Based UI Development:** The `FAQAddDialog.vue` file demonstrates heavy reliance on a UI component library (e.g., Shadcn Vue based on the component names like `Dialog`, `Select`, `Input`, `Button`) for building structured and interactive interfaces.
*   **Iterative Frontend Development:** The rapid sequence of changes to `FAQAddDialog.vue` within minutes highlights an iterative development and debugging process for Vue components, particularly concerning prop handling.
*   **Standardized Error and Success Feedback:** The `FAQAddDialog.vue` component consistently uses a `useToast` composable to provide standardized visual feedback to the user upon successful operations or encountered errors.
*   **Form Validation:** Basic client-side form validation is implemented in the `FAQAddDialog.vue` component to ensure required fields are filled before processing.
