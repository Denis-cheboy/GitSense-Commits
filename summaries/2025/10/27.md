# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 10:07:56 AM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on environment configuration and continuous deployment pipelines for an "ambulensi-server" project, occurring on October 24, 2025.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\.env.dev`**: This development environment file was updated multiple times between 11:33 AM and 12:56 PM. The changes involved populating specific configuration values related to Google iOS client ID and Apple Team ID. Due to the sensitive nature of this file, no further details on its content changes are provided.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-dev.yaml`**: This Google Cloud Build configuration for the development environment underwent several modifications between 11:35 AM and 11:46 AM.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:35:24 AM)**: The file outlined a standard CI/CD pipeline, including steps to fetch secrets from Secret Manager, build a Docker image with Sentry DSN and Auth Token as build arguments, push the image to Google Container Registry, and deploy it to a Cloud Run service named `ambulensi-server-dev` in the `europe-west1` region. It defined a comprehensive list of environment variable substitutions, covering application URLs, GCP resources, Traccar integration, Zoho details, various support emails, Celcom API settings, and Google OAuth client IDs. Notably, several `echo` commands for Google OAuth client IDs were initially incorrectly configured, repeating `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. The `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was initially empty.
    *   **Google OAuth ID Population (11:35:43 AM)**: The `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitution was updated with a specific ID.
    *   **Syntax Corrections (11:36:14 AM - 11:36:38 AM)**: A rapid series of commits addressed and corrected the syntax errors in the `bash` script within the "Fetch secrets from Secret Manager" step. Specifically, the `echo` commands for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` were progressively fixed to correctly write their respective variable names to `/workspace/secrets.yaml` instead of `CELCOM_BASE_URL`. The final correction was made at 11:36:38 AM.
    *   **Minor Re-save (11:46:28 AM)**: No functional changes were observed in the last recorded update for this file compared to the immediate preceding version.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-prod.yaml`**: This Google Cloud Build configuration for the production environment also saw updates.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:37:12 AM)**: Similar to the dev configuration, it defined steps for fetching secrets, building, pushing, and deploying a Docker image to `ambulensi-server-prod`. It used production-specific URLs, a different GCP project ID (`ambulensi-381516`), and a distinct service account. Initially, `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were empty.
    *   **Google OAuth ID Population (11:37:42 AM)**: Both `_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` and `_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` substitutions were populated with specific IDs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/24/2025, 11:33 AM**: Initial changes to the development environment file (`.env.dev`).
*   **10/24/2025, 11:35 AM - 11:37 AM**: A concentrated period of updates and corrections to both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` files, specifically around Google OAuth configurations and the CI/CD pipeline's secret handling.
*   **10/24/2025, 12:56 PM**: A later update to the development environment file, indicating ongoing configuration adjustments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cloud Build Pipeline Consistency**: Both `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` follow a consistent pattern: fetching secrets, building a Docker image, pushing it to a registry, and deploying to Google Cloud Run.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration**: There is a clear separation of configurations for development and production environments, using distinct URLs, GCP project IDs, bucket names, and service accounts.
*   **Extensive Use of Environment Variables/Substitutions**: A large number of variables are configured across both `.env.dev` and the Cloud Build `substitutions` block, indicating a dependency on external services and APIs (GCP, Traccar, Zoho, SendGrid, Sentry, Celcom, Google Maps, Google OAuth, Apple Sign In, OneSignal).
*   **Frequent Google OAuth & Apple Sign In Adjustments**: Updates consistently involve Google OAuth client IDs and Apple Sign In details, suggesting active integration or refinement of these authentication methods.
*   **Error Correction in Pipeline Scripts**: A series of quick fixes in `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` highlights iterative development and debugging of the CI/CD script, specifically concerning how Google OAuth client IDs were being passed to the deployed service.

## 11:54:09 AM
The logs show a focused effort on integrating and refining social authentication features, particularly for Apple Sign-In, within the `ambulensi-server` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**:
    *   **Initial Setup and Refinements (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 11:32:28 AM):** This service was introduced or significantly updated to handle Apple ID token verification. Key changes included adding a `serviceId` property, derived from `APPLE_SERVICE_ID` in configuration, alongside the existing `clientId` (from `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`). The initial commit at 11:32:07 AM declared `serviceId` within the constructor but it was formalized as a private class property by 11:32:28 AM.
    *   **Configuration Validation (10/27/2025, 11:33:18 AM):** A crucial enhancement was added to the constructor to validate the presence of `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `APPLE_SERVICE_ID`. If either is missing, it now logs an error and throws an `Error` indicating incomplete Apple Sign-In configuration, preventing the service from operating incorrectly.
    *   **Method Visibility Adjustments (10/27/2025, 11:38:16 AM - 11:38:24 AM):** The `extractEmailFromToken` method initially had implicit public access. It was briefly changed to `private` at 11:38:16 AM, and then reverted back to its original public accessibility at 11:38:24 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.module.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:15 AM)**:
    *   This file defines the `SocialAuthModule`, responsible for organizing social authentication components. It imports necessary NestJS modules like `ConfigModule` and `PassportModule`, along with application-specific `UserModule` and `TokenGenerationModule`. The module registers `SocialAuthController` and a suite of providers: `SocialAuthService`, `AppleTokenVerifierService`, `GoogleTokenVerifierService`, and `GoogleUserInfoService`, making them available for dependency injection within the social authentication context.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:42:29 AM)**:
    *   This service acts as the central orchestrator for social logins. It now contains `handleGoogleTokenAuth` and `handleAppleSignIn` methods. The `handleAppleSignIn` method shows detailed logic for processing Apple Sign-In requests, including verifying the ID token, handling `nonce` verification, and extracting user details like email, first name, last name, and private email status, with robust fallback mechanisms for missing data. A private `processUserAuthentication` method encapsulates common logic for finding or creating users, updating their status (e.g., `UserStatus.active`, `isVerified`), marking first logins, and generating authentication tokens.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM:** Initial implementation or major update of `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`, setting up core Apple token verification.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:33:18 AM:** Introduction of configuration validation logic in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`, enhancing stability.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:42:15 AM:** Formal definition of `social-auth.module.ts`, structuring the social authentication feature.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:42:29 AM:** Implementation of `social-auth.service.ts`, providing the business logic for Google and Apple social logins.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Social Authentication Focus:** The changes predominantly revolve around integrating and solidifying social login capabilities, specifically for Apple and Google, within the application.
*   **Modularity and Dependency Injection:** The code utilizes NestJS's modular structure and dependency injection heavily, with dedicated modules and services for specific functionalities (e.g., token verification, user management).
*   **Configuration-Driven Development:** Services are configured via `ConfigService`, retrieving values like `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` and `APPLE_SERVICE_ID`, indicating a flexible, environment-aware setup.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Extensive use of `Logger` for debugging and error reporting, coupled with `UnauthorizedException` for failed authentication attempts, highlights a focus on application stability and diagnosability.
*   **Token-Based Authentication:** The process consistently involves verifying ID tokens from social providers, extracting user payloads, and then generating application-specific access tokens.
*   **User Provisioning and Updates:** A common flow involves checking if a user exists based on their social profile, creating them if new, and updating their status and login timestamps for existing users.
