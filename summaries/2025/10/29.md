# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 10:28:49 AM
The changes log primarily details development related to EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) integration for contact synchronization across two PHP files: `contact.php` and `cron_epos_sync.php`. All recorded modifications occurred on October 29, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`site\contact.php`**: This file, responsible for contact management in the web application, underwent several updates:
    *   Initial state (circa 9:44 AM): It provided core contact functionalities including search, insert, display, and integration with existing gun/ammo/multi-book out transactions, along with print media styling for contact pages.
    *   **Significant Change (10/29/2025, 9:47:35 AM)**: A new PHP function `queue_epos_sync($contact_id, $action = 'update')` was introduced. This function is designed to mark a contact for synchronization with an EPOS system by updating `contact_epos_sync_status` to 'pending' and resetting `contact_epos_sync_attempts` in the `contact` database table. It also included a commented-out section for an "advanced" queueing method using a separate `epos_sync_queue` table.
    *   **Refinement (10/29/2025, 9:47:45 AM)**: The commented-out code block for the "advanced" EPOS queue table was removed, streamlining the `queue_epos_sync` function to exclusively use the `contact` table's flags.
    *   **Minor Reordering (10/29/2025, 10:03:17 AM)**: The `queue_epos_sync` function's definition was reordered within the file, moving it slightly higher up.

*   **`site\cron_epos_sync.php`**: This file, introduced during these changes, functions as a background worker for EPOS synchronization.
    *   **Initial Creation (10/29/2025, 9:50:30 AM)**: The script was created, designed for command-line execution (with an optional web override). It defined constants for batch size, max attempts, timeout, and rate limiting. It featured `process_epos_queue_simple()` to identify and process pending contacts, checking for their existence in EPOS before performing an update or create operation via `oEpos->updateContactViaRFD()` or `oEpos->sendContactViaRFD()`. It updated the contact's sync status and attempt count. A more "advanced" queueing method using a separate table was present but commented out.
    *   **Refinement (10/29/2025, 9:51:15 AM)**: The `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` configuration constant and its usage to set a timeout on the `Epos` object were removed.
    *   **Simplification (10/29/2025, 9:53:58 AM)**: The commented-out `process_epos_queue_advanced()` function was completely removed, indicating a decision to proceed solely with the simpler queueing mechanism using contact table flags.
    *   **Minor Change (10/29/2025, 10:18:14 AM)**: The `require_once('site_globals.php');` statement was changed to `require('site_globals.php');`.
    *   **Potential Security / Access Change (10/29/2025, 10:27:00 AM)**: The initial code block preventing the script from being run via a web browser (unless `?allow_web=1` was present) was commented out, potentially exposing the cron job to direct web access. The `chdir(__DIR__);` statement was also commented out at this time, which might affect relative path resolution.
    *   **Further Modification (10/29/2025, 10:27:33 AM)**: The `chdir(__DIR__);` line remained commented out, while the web access prevention block remained disabled.

*   **`scripts\cron_epos_sync.php`**: This file appears to be a relocation of the EPOS sync worker.
    *   **Relocation and Path Adjustment (10/29/2025, 10:12:30 AM)**: The `cron_epos_sync.php` script was moved from the `site\` directory to `scripts\`. Correspondingly, the `require_once` path for `site_globals.php` was updated from `site_globals.php` to `site/site_globals.php` to reflect the new relative location. The content matches the state of `site\cron_epos_sync.php` after the `process_epos_queue_advanced()` function removal.
    *   **Path Inaccuracy (10/29/2025, 10:12:51 AM)**: The `require_once` path was changed to `/site/site_globals.php`, making it an absolute path from the root.
    *   **Configuration Issue (10/29/2025, 10:12:59 AM)**: The `require_once` statement for `site_globals.php` was commented out entirely, indicating a potential issue with resolving the path to critical global settings.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **EPOS Synchronization:** The dominant theme is the implementation and refinement of an EPOS synchronization mechanism for contact data. This involves identifying pending contacts, attempting to synchronize them (create or update), and tracking sync status and attempts.
*   **Queueing Strategy:** An initial consideration for a dedicated queue table (`epos_sync_queue`) was quickly abandoned in favor of using flags directly within the `contact` table to manage pending syncs.
*   **Logging and Error Handling:** Both files use `site_create_notification` and `log_sync`/`error_log` for feedback and debugging, and include basic exception handling for EPOS calls.
*   **File Organization:** A `cron_epos_sync.php` file was introduced, and later relocated to a `scripts\` directory, highlighting an evolution in project structure for background tasks.
*   **Dependency Pathing:** Changes to the `require`/`require_once` statements and the `chdir(__DIR__)` line in `cron_epos_sync.php` suggest ongoing adjustments and potential issues with how dependencies are loaded from different script locations.
*   **Web Access Management:** The `cron_epos_sync.php` script initially enforced command-line execution but later had this restriction commented out, which could have implications for security or intended execution environment.
