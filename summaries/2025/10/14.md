# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 11:46:03 AM
The changes log details several updates across three Vue components within the `GunRegister` project, all occurring on October 14, 2025, between 11:02 AM and 11:35 AM, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\layouts\Footer.vue`**:
    *   Initially defined a standard application footer, including company information, navigation links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, FAQ, Support), copyright details, and regulatory text. It featured placeholders like `Register 2026` and `Last updated: January 2024`.
    *   At **10/14/2025, 11:02:29 AM**, a significant update added a `<script setup lang="ts">` block. This block imports `computed` from Vue and dynamically calculates the `currentYear` for the copyright notice (`Â© {{ currentYear }} Register 2026`), replacing a static value. The `Link` and `Separator` components are also explicitly imported for use within the template.
    *   The `Footer` component was then integrated into the `AppHeaderLayout.vue` at **10/14/2025, 11:02:50 AM**.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\layouts\app\AppHeaderLayout.vue`**:
    *   At **10/14/2025, 11:02:50 AM**, this file was introduced (or significantly updated), defining a core application layout. It imports and composes several components: `AppContent`, `AppHeader`, `AppShell`, `ToastHost`, `AdminNavigation`, and the newly updated `Footer`. It also defines props for `breadcrumbs`. The template structures these components, suggesting a standardized header, navigation, content area, and footer for the application.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\support\TicketCreateDialog.vue`**:
    *   This file was initially created around **10/14/2025, 11:07:22 AM**, implementing a "Create Support Ticket" dialog. The dialog features a comprehensive form including fields for subject, shop/business name, category (e.g., Technical, Account, Compliance, Billing), priority (Low to Critical), preferred contact method, and a detailed description. A key feature is the file upload functionality for attachments (screenshots, logs, documents, with a 10MB per file limit), allowing users to add and remove files. Client-side validation is implemented, showing error toasts for missing required fields and success toasts upon ticket creation.
    *   A notable refactoring occurred at **10/14/2025, 11:17:41 AM**, where the import path for `useToast` was updated from `@/components/ui/toast` to `@/composables/useToast`, indicating a move towards a more organized `composables` pattern for reusable logic.
    *   Further minor refinements between **10/14/2025, 11:25:41 AM** and **11:32:52 AM** included the removal of an unused `@inertiajs/vue3` `router` import and brief experimentation with `defineProps` and `defineEmits` syntax before settling on explicit type declarations for emitted events and destructuring of the `open` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\admin\ShopDialogue.vue`**:
    *   This component was introduced around **10/14/2025, 11:35:49 AM**. It provides a detailed dialog for "Create/Edit Shop" functionality, utilizing a tabbed interface with "Details", "Licensing", "Settings", and "Terms" sections.
        *   **Details**: Covers basic shop info (name, email, telephone, company/VAT numbers), address details (shop, registered address, postcodes), and system configuration (shop ID, storage rate, EPOS IR Key, Shop App Key with regeneration, active account status, start/stop dates). Form validation errors are displayed for required fields.
        *   **Licensing**: Manages RFD Licence details (number, expiry, authority selection) and includes `FileUpload` components for the RFD Licence document and shop logo.
        *   **Settings**: A placeholder tab, indicating "Settings panel coming soon...".
        *   **Terms**: Allows entry of various terms and conditions (General, Storage, Repair, Invoice Text, New Sales, Used Sales) using `Textarea` fields.
    *   The component leverages `useForm` for state management and form submission, `lucide-vue-next` for icons, and a wide array of UI components from a shared library.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue 3 Composition API**: All new and modified Vue components consistently use the `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax, indicating a modern, type-safe development approach.
*   **UI Component Library**: A consistent set of UI components (e.g., `Dialog`, `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Checkbox`, `Separator`) is utilized across different components, suggesting the use of a unified design system like Shadcn UI (or similar).
*   **`@inertiajs/vue3` Integration**: `Link` and `useForm` from Inertia.js are used for client-side routing and efficient form handling, respectively, implying a Laravel/Inertia backend.
*   **Iconography**: The `lucide-vue-next` library is consistently used for icons (e.g., `Upload`, `X`, `Building2`, `MapPin`, `Settings`, `Key`, `Shield`, `FileText`), providing a uniform visual language.
*   **Form Validation and Feedback**: Components feature client-side validation for required fields, often displaying error messages directly below inputs, and use `useToast` for user notifications (success/error).
*   **Timestamp Consistency**: All changes were recorded within a single hour on the same day, indicating a focused period of feature development and refactoring.
