# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 11:46:03 AM
The changes log details several updates across three Vue components within the `GunRegister` project, all occurring on October 14, 2025, between 11:02 AM and 11:35 AM, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\layouts\Footer.vue`**:
    *   Initially defined a standard application footer, including company information, navigation links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, FAQ, Support), copyright details, and regulatory text. It featured placeholders like `Register 2026` and `Last updated: January 2024`.
    *   At **10/14/2025, 11:02:29 AM**, a significant update added a `<script setup lang="ts">` block. This block imports `computed` from Vue and dynamically calculates the `currentYear` for the copyright notice (`Â© {{ currentYear }} Register 2026`), replacing a static value. The `Link` and `Separator` components are also explicitly imported for use within the template.
    *   The `Footer` component was then integrated into the `AppHeaderLayout.vue` at **10/14/2025, 11:02:50 AM**.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\layouts\app\AppHeaderLayout.vue`**:
    *   At **10/14/2025, 11:02:50 AM**, this file was introduced (or significantly updated), defining a core application layout. It imports and composes several components: `AppContent`, `AppHeader`, `AppShell`, `ToastHost`, `AdminNavigation`, and the newly updated `Footer`. It also defines props for `breadcrumbs`. The template structures these components, suggesting a standardized header, navigation, content area, and footer for the application.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\support\TicketCreateDialog.vue`**:
    *   This file was initially created around **10/14/2025, 11:07:22 AM**, implementing a "Create Support Ticket" dialog. The dialog features a comprehensive form including fields for subject, shop/business name, category (e.g., Technical, Account, Compliance, Billing), priority (Low to Critical), preferred contact method, and a detailed description. A key feature is the file upload functionality for attachments (screenshots, logs, documents, with a 10MB per file limit), allowing users to add and remove files. Client-side validation is implemented, showing error toasts for missing required fields and success toasts upon ticket creation.
    *   A notable refactoring occurred at **10/14/2025, 11:17:41 AM**, where the import path for `useToast` was updated from `@/components/ui/toast` to `@/composables/useToast`, indicating a move towards a more organized `composables` pattern for reusable logic.
    *   Further minor refinements between **10/14/2025, 11:25:41 AM** and **11:32:52 AM** included the removal of an unused `@inertiajs/vue3` `router` import and brief experimentation with `defineProps` and `defineEmits` syntax before settling on explicit type declarations for emitted events and destructuring of the `open` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\admin\ShopDialogue.vue`**:
    *   This component was introduced around **10/14/2025, 11:35:49 AM**. It provides a detailed dialog for "Create/Edit Shop" functionality, utilizing a tabbed interface with "Details", "Licensing", "Settings", and "Terms" sections.
        *   **Details**: Covers basic shop info (name, email, telephone, company/VAT numbers), address details (shop, registered address, postcodes), and system configuration (shop ID, storage rate, EPOS IR Key, Shop App Key with regeneration, active account status, start/stop dates). Form validation errors are displayed for required fields.
        *   **Licensing**: Manages RFD Licence details (number, expiry, authority selection) and includes `FileUpload` components for the RFD Licence document and shop logo.
        *   **Settings**: A placeholder tab, indicating "Settings panel coming soon...".
        *   **Terms**: Allows entry of various terms and conditions (General, Storage, Repair, Invoice Text, New Sales, Used Sales) using `Textarea` fields.
    *   The component leverages `useForm` for state management and form submission, `lucide-vue-next` for icons, and a wide array of UI components from a shared library.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue 3 Composition API**: All new and modified Vue components consistently use the `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax, indicating a modern, type-safe development approach.
*   **UI Component Library**: A consistent set of UI components (e.g., `Dialog`, `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Checkbox`, `Separator`) is utilized across different components, suggesting the use of a unified design system like Shadcn UI (or similar).
*   **`@inertiajs/vue3` Integration**: `Link` and `useForm` from Inertia.js are used for client-side routing and efficient form handling, respectively, implying a Laravel/Inertia backend.
*   **Iconography**: The `lucide-vue-next` library is consistently used for icons (e.g., `Upload`, `X`, `Building2`, `MapPin`, `Settings`, `Key`, `Shield`, `FileText`), providing a uniform visual language.
*   **Form Validation and Feedback**: Components feature client-side validation for required fields, often displaying error messages directly below inputs, and use `useToast` for user notifications (success/error).
*   **Timestamp Consistency**: All changes were recorded within a single hour on the same day, indicating a focused period of feature development and refactoring.

## 11:52:08 AM
The `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\guntrader\src\index.css` file, last modified on 10/14/2025 at 10:52:06 AM, primarily defines a comprehensive CSS theme for a "Gun Trader" application using Tailwind CSS.

**Key Information from `src\index.css`:**

*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** The file starts with `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`, indicating its role in a Tailwind CSS project.
*   **Design System Foundation:** It explicitly registers "2026 Design System - Professional compliance application theme," suggesting a structured approach to styling.
*   **Extensive CSS Variable Definitions:** A wide array of CSS variables are defined within a `@layer base` for both a light theme (`:root`) and a dark theme (`.dark`). These variables cover:
    *   **Core Colors:** Background, foreground.
    *   **Surface Colors:** Card, popover.
    *   **Brand Colors:** Primary (dark green for light mode, blue for dark mode), with light, dark, and foreground variants.
    *   **Secondary, Muted, and Accent Tones:** With corresponding foreground colors.
    *   **Status Colors:** Success, warning, destructive, each with foreground and light background variants. Specific badge status colors (`--status-ok`, `--status-withdrawn`, `--status-pending`) are also defined.
    *   **UI Elements:** Border, input, ring.
    *   **Navigation:** Background, foreground, accent, muted.
    *   **Table & Data Display:** Header, border, hover, selected states.
    *   **Sidebar:** A complete set of variables for background, foreground, primary, accent, border, and ring specific to a sidebar component.
*   **Gradients:** Predefined linear gradients for primary, subtle, and navigation elements.
*   **Shadows:** Semantic shadow variables (`--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`, `--shadow-nav`) with specific HSL color and opacity values.
*   **Transitions:** Variables for different transition speeds (`--transition-base`, `--transition-fast`, `--transition-slow`) using cubic-bezier functions.
*   **Radius:** A base radius of `0.5rem` is set.
*   **Base Styling:** Default styles are applied to all elements (`*`) for border and to the `body` for background and text colors using the defined CSS variables.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HSL Color Format:** A prominent pattern is the exclusive use of HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) for all color variables, ensuring consistency and ease of manipulation as explicitly noted in the comments ("All colors MUST be HSL for proper CSS variable usage.").
*   **Dual Theming (Light/Dark):** The file establishes a clear light mode (`:root`) and dark mode (`.dark`) color scheme, with nearly all CSS variables having distinct values for both themes.
*   **Semantic Naming Conventions:** Variables are consistently named based on their semantic purpose (e.g., `--primary`, `--success`, `--card`, `--nav-background`), which improves code readability and maintainability.
*   **Categorization of Variables:** Variables are logically grouped by their functional area (e.g., Core, Surface, Brand, Status, Navigation, Table, Sidebar), making the stylesheet highly organized.
*   **Professional Styling:** The inclusion of specific shadow values, transition functions, and status/badge colors suggests a detailed and professional approach to UI design.
*   **"Gun Trader" Branding:** The primary color palette and comments directly reference a "Gun Trader Dark Green Theme" for the light mode, indicating brand-specific styling.

The changes log primarily details the development and refinement of support ticket management features across three Vue.js components: `TicketViewDialog.vue`, `TicketList.vue`, and `Support.vue`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\support\TicketViewDialog.vue`**
    *   **Initial Development (10/14/2025, 12:03:58 PM - 12:10:31 PM):** This file saw extensive development, starting from empty `<template>` and `<script>` tags to a fully structured dialog for viewing and interacting with support tickets. Key elements added included:
        *   Display of ticket details: subject, ID, priority, status, creation date, category, shop name, contact method, and description.
        *   A dedicated section for attachments with file details and a download button.
        *   A conversation history displaying original ticket description and subsequent responses.
        *   A response form allowing users to type messages and update the ticket status.
        *   Initial Vue.js binding syntax (`onOpenChange={onOpenChange}`) was progressively corrected to idiomatic Vue 3 event handling (`@update:open='$emit("update:open", $event)'`).
        *   Imports for UI components (`Dialog`, `Textarea`) were added and later refactored to use alias paths (`@/components/ui/`).
        *   An `emits` definition was introduced and refined for `update:open`.
    *   **Major Reintroduction/Refinement (10/14/2025, 12:13:25 PM):** After a temporary empty state at 12:10:59 PM, the component was fully reintroduced using `<script setup lang="ts">`. This version solidified the component's functionality, including:
        *   Comprehensive imports of UI components and Lucide icons.
        *   TypeScript interfaces for `Ticket` and `Props`.
        *   Reactive state (`newResponse`, `newStatus`) and a watcher for `ticket.status`.
        *   `handleSendResponse` logic for updating ticket responses and status, and showing toast notifications.
        *   Detailed helper functions for styling priorities, icons for statuses, date formatting, and file size formatting.
    *   **Final Touches (10/14/2025, 12:15:17 PM):** A minor but notable refactoring changed the import path for `useToast` from `@/components/ui/toast` to `@/composables/useToast`, indicating a move towards a more organized composables directory.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\components\support\TicketList.vue`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (10/14/2025, 12:11:28 PM):** This component was introduced to display a list of support tickets.
        *   It incorporated search and filter functionalities (by status and category) using `searchTerm`, `filterStatus`, and `filterCategory` refs and a `filteredTickets` computed property.
        *   Each ticket in the list shows subject, ID, priority, status (with icons and colors), creation date, shop name, category, attachment count, and a truncated description.
        *   Buttons to "View Details" (opening `TicketViewDialog`) and "Start Progress" or "Mark Resolved" were included.
        *   Emits an `updateTicket` event for parent components.
    *   **Refactoring Imports (10/14/2025, 12:14:15 PM):** The import statement for `TicketViewDialog` was adjusted, likely to align with its new export structure (`import TicketViewDialog from './TicketViewDialog.vue'`).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\pages\Support.vue`**
    *   **Comprehensive Page Structure (10/14/2025, 12:28:54 PM):** This file defines the main "Support Centre" page, integrating the ticket components and providing overall support functionality.
        *   Includes layout components (`Header`, `AdminNavigation`, `Footer`).
        *   Imports `TicketCreateDialog` and `TicketList`.
        *   Manages a central `tickets` array (with sample data) and functions (`handleCreateTicket`, `handleUpdateTicket`) to manipulate it.
        *   Displays statistics like "Open Tickets", "In Progress", "Resolved Today", and "Total Tickets" using computed properties.
        *   Organizes content into tabs: "My Tickets" (which uses `TicketList`), "Contact Support" (detailing contact methods and emergency contacts), "Help Resources" (quick help links and office location), and "System Status" (showing application, database, and storage status, plus recent updates).
    *   **Minor Import Fixes (10/14/2025, 12:29:05 PM - 12:42:46 PM):** A recurring pattern of incomplete import statements for the `Header` component was observed over multiple timestamps, which was eventually resolved.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/14/2025, 12:03:58 PM:** Initial large-scale implementation of the `TicketViewDialog` template.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:05:07 PM:** Corrected Vue 3 event binding for `Dialog` in `TicketViewDialog`.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:11:28 PM:** Introduction of the `TicketList` component.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:13:25 PM:** Complete rewrite/reintroduction of `TicketViewDialog` using `<script setup lang="ts">` and full logic.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:15:17 PM:** Refactoring of `useToast` import path in `TicketViewDialog`.
*   **10/14/2025, 12:28:54 PM:** Introduction of the `Support` page, integrating all support-related components and features.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript:** All major components (`TicketViewDialog`, `TicketList`, `Support` page) consistently use `<script setup lang="ts">`, `ref`, `computed`, `watch`, and explicit TypeScript interfaces for props and data.
*   **Shadcn-like UI Components:** There's a strong reliance on a component library imported from `@/components/ui/` for various UI elements (Dialog, Card, Button, Badge, Select, Textarea, Tabs, Input, Separator), indicating a consistent design system.
*   **Lucide Icons:** Icons from `lucide-vue-next` are used extensively across all components to visually enhance information (e.g., status icons, action icons).
*   **Centralized Ticket Data:** The `Support.vue` page holds the primary `tickets` data and passes it down to `TicketList`, which then passes a `selectedTicket` to `TicketViewDialog`. Updates are emitted back up the component hierarchy.
*   **Helper Functions for Formatting/Styling:** Functions like `formatDate`, `formatFileSize`, `getPriorityColor`, `getStatusIcon`, `getStatusColor`, `getStatusIconClass` are common patterns to ensure consistent data presentation and visual cues.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Refactoring:** Several entries show quick iterations, incomplete syntax, and subsequent corrections, particularly around Vue bindings and import paths, suggesting an active development process.
