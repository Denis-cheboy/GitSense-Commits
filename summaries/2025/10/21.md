# Activity Summary for 10/21/2025

## 11:06:44 AM
The `ambulensi-server` project primarily saw updates related to Apple Sign-In functionality within its social authentication module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:30:00 AM - 10:31:02 AM:** The `verifyIdToken` method was modified to accept an optional `rawNonce` parameter, and a new private method `verifyNonce` was introduced. This `verifyNonce` method implements SHA256 hashing to compare a nonce from the ID token with a provided raw nonce, which is a crucial security measure for Apple Sign-In. The `crypto` module was imported to support this hashing.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:16 AM:** A minor, transient change was made to use optional chaining (`decoded?.nonce`) when accessing the nonce, which was then reverted almost immediately.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was extended to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, reflecting the token content.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** A new public method `extractEmailFromToken(idToken: string): string | null` was added to facilitate extracting the email directly from the ID token.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:41:09 AM - 10:41:35 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was further updated to include an optional `is_private_email?: boolean` property, addressing Apple's private email relay feature.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:37:33 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was refactored for clarity in how the user's email is determined, ensuring it prioritizes the DTO's email, then the token's email, and finally the extracted email.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** The logic for validating the Apple `authorizationCode` was removed from the `handleAppleSignIn` method, suggesting a change in flow or responsibility for this validation.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was updated to extract `isPrivateEmail` from the token payload and include it in the `SocialProfile` object.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:57 AM - 10:46:29 AM:** Adjustments were made in `handleAppleSignIn` regarding how `dto.nonce` is handled. Initially, there was a brief attempt to pass `dto.nonce` to `extractEmailFromToken` (which was incorrect), but this was quickly corrected to pass `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken`, aligning with the nonce verification logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM:** The `SocialProfile` interface was updated to include an optional `isPrivateEmail?: boolean` property, reflecting the information now extracted from Apple ID tokens.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** The `AppleSignInDto` was enhanced to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, allowing the client to provide the raw nonce for verification.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/21/2025, 10:30:21 AM:** Introduction of the `verifyNonce` method in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:02 AM:** Completion of nonce verification logic with the import of the `crypto` module.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** Update of `AppleTokenPayload` to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** Addition of `extractEmailFromToken` method.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** Removal of `authorizationCode` validation from `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** Introduction of `isPrivateEmail` handling in `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:41:35 AM:** Finalization of `AppleTokenPayload` with `is_private_email` as a boolean.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** `AppleSignInDto` updated to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:46:29 AM:** Corrected passing of `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken` in `SocialAuthService`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently revolve around enhancing and securing the **Apple Sign-In** authentication flow. Key patterns include:
*   **Nonce Verification:** Repeated modifications in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts` and `social-auth.service.ts` to correctly implement and utilize nonce verification for Apple ID tokens, which is a critical security practice against replay attacks.
*   **Apple Private Email Relay:** Integration of Apple's `is_private_email` feature by adding it to relevant interfaces and extracting it during the sign-in process.
*   **Interface and DTO Synchronization:** As logic changes were implemented in services, corresponding updates were made to `AppleTokenPayload` (interface for token content), `SocialProfile` (interface for user social data), and `AppleSignInDto` (data transfer object for sign-in requests) to maintain type consistency and data flow.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `Logger` and `UnauthorizedException` for robust error reporting and debugging, particularly for social authentication failures.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple timestamps for the same files within a short period suggest an iterative development process, with frequent saves and minor adjustments to logic and types.

*   **Consistent Timestamps:** All changes occurred on the same date within a span of approximately 20 minutes for `apple-token-verifier.service.ts` and 10 minutes for `social-auth.service.ts`, suggesting a focused development session on the Apple authentication flow.

## 1:07:07 PM
The changes log details a series of updates primarily focused on enhancing social authentication (specifically Apple Sign-In) and integrating a push notification system using OneSignal within the `ambulensi-server` project. All significant changes occurred on 10/21/2025, spanning from approximately 10:29 AM to 1:06 PM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**
    *   **10:29:37 AM - 10:31:45 AM**: Introduced nonce verification for Apple ID tokens. This involved modifying the `verifyIdToken` method to accept an optional `rawNonce`, adding a `private verifyNonce` method that hashes the `rawNonce` using the `crypto` module (imported at 10:31:02 AM) and compares it against the token's nonce, and updating the `AppleTokenPayload` interface to include `nonce?: string`.
    *   **10:36:22 AM**: Added an `extractEmailFromToken` utility method to safely retrieve an email address from an Apple ID token.
    *   **10:41:09 AM - 10:41:35 AM**: The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was updated to include an `is_private_email?: boolean` field, reflecting Apple's private email relay service.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **10:37:33 AM**: The logic within `handleAppleSignIn` for extracting the user's email was refined to prioritize DTO-provided email, then token payload email, and finally the newly added `extractEmailFromToken` utility.
    *   **10:38:30 AM**: The call to `this.validateAppleAuthorizationCode` within `handleAppleSignIn` was removed, suggesting a change in the authorization flow for Apple Sign-In.
    *   **10:40:05 AM**: Implemented logic to extract and include `isPrivateEmail` from the Apple token payload into the `socialProfile`.
    *   **10:45:57 AM - 10:46:29 AM**: The call to `this.appleTokenVerifier.verifyIdToken` in `handleAppleSignIn` was updated to correctly pass the `dto.nonce` for nonce verification. There was a brief, corrected inconsistency where `extractEmailFromToken` was incorrectly passed `dto.nonce` at 10:45:57 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM**: The `SocialProfile` interface was extended to include an optional `isPrivateEmail` field, initially defined as a string and then corrected to a boolean type.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`**
    *   **10:45:04 AM**: An optional `nonce?: string` property was added to the `AppleSignInDto` to support nonce verification.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\interfaces\onesignal-options.interface.ts`**
    *   **12:47:57 PM**: This file defines various interfaces for OneSignal integration, including `OneSignalModuleOptions`, `NotificationPayload`, and `SendNotificationOptions`, providing structure for push notification configuration and data.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\constants\onesignal.constants.ts`**
    *   **12:49:44 PM**: Defined `ONESIGNAL_CONFIG` constant and enums such as `UserRole` (DRIVER, EMT, ADMIN) and `NotificationType` (e.g., TASK_CREATED, TASK_ASSIGNED, TASK_COMPLETED), crucial for categorizing notifications.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.module.ts`**
    *   **12:51:27 PM - 1:02:22 PM**: The module underwent significant restructuring. It was initially an empty `PushNotificationModule`, then incorporated and renamed a `OneSignalModule` with `forRoot` and `forRootAsync` methods for dynamic configuration. Key changes included renaming the class to `PushNotificationModule` (12:51:37 PM), correcting internal module references (12:52:45 PM), and adjusting import paths for constants (12:52:58 PM) and the service (1:02:22 PM) to reflect the new structure.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **12:54:40 PM - 12:55:28 PM**: This file evolved from an incomplete class declaration to a full `OneSignalService` implementation. This service integrates with `@onesignal/node-onesignal`, providing methods to initialize the client and send various types of notifications (to external user IDs, player IDs, segments, or with filters), as well as to cancel and retrieve notification details. It includes a private `buildNotification` method for constructing OneSignal API payloads.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\services\task-notification\task-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **1:05:54 PM - 1:06:15 PM**: This new service was created to handle task-related notifications. It defines a `Task` interface and injects the `OneSignalService`. It provides methods to send notifications for various task lifecycle events (e.g., `notifyTaskCreated`, `notifyTaskUpdated`, `notifyTaskCancelled`, `notifyTaskCompleted`, `notifyUrgentTask`), directing them to drivers and/or EMTs. It imports `OneSignalService` at 1:06:00 PM and `NotificationType` at 1:06:15 PM to support its functionality.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Enhanced Social Authentication**: A major theme is the robustification of Apple Sign-In, focusing on security (nonce verification) and feature parity (private email handling).
*   **Push Notification System Integration**: There's a clear effort to introduce and standardize push notifications through OneSignal, building out the core module, service, and relevant interfaces/constants.
*   **Modular NestJS Architecture**: The changes consistently follow NestJS patterns, using `@Injectable()`, `@Module()`, dependency injection, and logger instances for each service.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: `Logger` instances are extensively used across services (`this.logger.log`, `this.logger.error`) within `try...catch` blocks, indicating a focus on operational visibility and graceful error recovery.
*   **Rapid Development and Refinement**: The timestamp progression shows quick iterations, with fixes for import paths and minor code inconsistencies appearing rapidly after initial implementations.

## 2:07:32 PM
The code changes primarily focus on two distinct areas: enhancing Apple Sign-In functionality and integrating OneSignal for push notifications, including a new service for task-related notifications.

**Key Information by File Path:**

    *   **Updates:** This service underwent significant refinement for Apple ID token verification.
        *   The `verifyIdToken` method was updated to accept an optional `rawNonce` for nonce validation (10:30:00 AM).
        *   A private `verifyNonce` method was introduced to hash the `rawNonce` using `crypto` and compare it against the token's nonce, with the `crypto` module being explicitly imported (10:30:21 AM, 10:31:02 AM).
        *   The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was extended to include `nonce?: string` and `is_private_email?: boolean` (initially `string` then corrected to `boolean`) to reflect new data points from Apple tokens (10:31:45 AM, 10:41:09 AM, 10:41:35 AM).
        *   An `extractEmailFromToken` helper method was added to safely retrieve the email from a decoded ID token (10:36:22 AM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 10:35:10 AM - 10:46:29 AM**
    *   **Updates:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was modified to align with the changes in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`.
        *   Initially, `extractEmailFromToken` was called without the nonce parameter, then temporarily with `dto.nonce` (10:45:57 AM), and finally corrected to pass `dto.nonce` directly to `verifyIdToken` for nonce validation (10:46:29 AM).
        *   The logic to validate `dto.authorizationCode` with Apple's token endpoint was removed from `handleAppleSignIn`, suggesting this step might be handled elsewhere or deemed unnecessary in this context (10:38:30 AM).
        *   The `socialProfile` object constructed during Apple Sign-In now extracts and includes an `isPrivateEmail` flag based on the token payload (10:40:05 AM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\constants\onesignal.constants.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 12:49:44 PM**
    *   **Updates:** Defined constants like `ONESIGNAL_CONFIG` and enums for `UserRole` and `NotificationType` (e.g., `TASK_CREATED`, `TASK_ASSIGNED`), crucial for categorizing and targeting notifications.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 12:54:40 PM - 1:43:32 PM**
    *   **Updates:** This file, initially an incomplete class, was fully implemented as `OneSignalService` (12:55:07 PM).
        *   It integrates the `@onesignal/node-onesignal` library, taking `OneSignalModuleOptions` via dependency injection to configure the client.
        *   Provided methods for sending notifications to specific users (`sendToUsers`), players (`sendToPlayers`), segments (`sendToSegments`), or with custom filters (`sendWithFilters`).
        *   Included utility methods for `cancelNotification` and `getNotification`.
        *   A `buildNotification` helper was created to construct OneSignal-compatible notification objects.
        *   Type assertions and extended configuration parameters were added to handle `userAuthKey` correctly during OneSignal client initialization (1:43:02 PM, 1:43:32 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.module.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 12:51:27 PM - 1:11:48 PM**
    *   **Updates:** This file evolved significantly to define a reusable NestJS module.
        *   It started with internal inconsistencies, referring to `OneSignalModule` while being named `PushNotificationModule` (12:51:27 PM - 12:52:21 PM).
        *   The module name in its static `forRoot` and `forRootAsync` methods was corrected to `PushNotificationModule` (12:52:45 PM).
        *   All necessary imports for `OneSignalService`, `ONESIGNAL_CONFIG`, `ConfigModule`, and related interfaces were added or corrected to use relative paths (12:52:58 PM, 1:02:22 PM).
        *   Crucially, the module class itself was renamed from `PushNotificationModule` to `OneSignalModule` to better reflect its purpose and resolve naming inconsistencies across the application (1:11:48 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\services\task-notification\task-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 1:05:54 PM - 1:06:15 PM**
    *   **Updates:** A new `TaskNotificationService` was created to handle specific notification logic for tasks.
        *   It depends on `OneSignalService` to send push notifications (1:06:00 PM).
        *   Methods were implemented for various task lifecycle events, such as `notifyTaskCreated`, `notifyDriver`, `notifyEmt`, `notifyUrgentTask`, `notifyTaskUpdated`, `notifyTaskCancelled`, and `notifyTaskCompleted`.
        *   The `NotificationType` enum was imported to categorize these notifications (1:06:15 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\task.module.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 1:09:35 PM**
    *   **Updates:** `TaskNotificationService` was added to the `providers` array, making it available for dependency injection within the `TaskModule`.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\app.module.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 1:10:10 PM - 1:35:54 PM**
    *   **Updates:** This file saw changes related to integrating the OneSignal module.
        *   Initially, an incorrect `OneSignalModule` path was used, and then a `forRootAsync` configuration for `OneSignalModule` was added to import and configure the module with environment variables via `ConfigService` (1:10:39 PM).
        *   The import path for `OneSignalModule` was corrected after its renaming (1:12:26 PM).
        *   The `OneSignalModule.forRootAsync` configuration was subsequently removed from `app.module.ts`, indicating a refactoring where its setup would be handled at a lower level (1:35:54 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\notification.module.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/21/2025, 1:36:11 PM - 1:36:42 PM**
    *   **Updates:** This module became the central point for configuring `OneSignalModule`.
        *   It now includes the `OneSignalModule.forRootAsync` configuration, which was moved from `app.module.ts`, thereby encapsulating the OneSignal setup within the `NotificationModule` (1:36:11 PM).
        *   Necessary imports for `OneSignalModule`, `ConfigModule`, and `ConfigService` were added to facilitate this configuration (1:36:17 PM, 1:36:36 PM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple consecutive commits to the same file (`apple-token-verifier.service.ts`, `push-notification.module.ts`, `push-notification.service.ts`) within short timeframes (often seconds to minutes) suggest an iterative development process, quickly fixing bugs (e.g., missing imports, type mismatches), or adjusting logic.
*   **Modularity and Dependency Injection:** The introduction of dedicated services (`AppleTokenVerifierService`, `OneSignalService`, `TaskNotificationService`) and NestJS modules (`OneSignalModule`, `NotificationModule`, `TaskModule`) demonstrates a commitment to modular architecture and heavy reliance on NestJS's dependency injection system.
