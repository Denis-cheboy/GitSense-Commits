# Activity Summary for 10/21/2025

## 11:06:44 AM
The `ambulensi-server` project primarily saw updates related to Apple Sign-In functionality within its social authentication module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:30:00 AM - 10:31:02 AM:** The `verifyIdToken` method was modified to accept an optional `rawNonce` parameter, and a new private method `verifyNonce` was introduced. This `verifyNonce` method implements SHA256 hashing to compare a nonce from the ID token with a provided raw nonce, which is a crucial security measure for Apple Sign-In. The `crypto` module was imported to support this hashing.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:16 AM:** A minor, transient change was made to use optional chaining (`decoded?.nonce`) when accessing the nonce, which was then reverted almost immediately.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was extended to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, reflecting the token content.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** A new public method `extractEmailFromToken(idToken: string): string | null` was added to facilitate extracting the email directly from the ID token.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:41:09 AM - 10:41:35 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was further updated to include an optional `is_private_email?: boolean` property, addressing Apple's private email relay feature.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:37:33 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was refactored for clarity in how the user's email is determined, ensuring it prioritizes the DTO's email, then the token's email, and finally the extracted email.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** The logic for validating the Apple `authorizationCode` was removed from the `handleAppleSignIn` method, suggesting a change in flow or responsibility for this validation.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was updated to extract `isPrivateEmail` from the token payload and include it in the `SocialProfile` object.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:57 AM - 10:46:29 AM:** Adjustments were made in `handleAppleSignIn` regarding how `dto.nonce` is handled. Initially, there was a brief attempt to pass `dto.nonce` to `extractEmailFromToken` (which was incorrect), but this was quickly corrected to pass `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken`, aligning with the nonce verification logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM:** The `SocialProfile` interface was updated to include an optional `isPrivateEmail?: boolean` property, reflecting the information now extracted from Apple ID tokens.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** The `AppleSignInDto` was enhanced to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, allowing the client to provide the raw nonce for verification.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/21/2025, 10:30:21 AM:** Introduction of the `verifyNonce` method in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:02 AM:** Completion of nonce verification logic with the import of the `crypto` module.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** Update of `AppleTokenPayload` to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** Addition of `extractEmailFromToken` method.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** Removal of `authorizationCode` validation from `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** Introduction of `isPrivateEmail` handling in `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:41:35 AM:** Finalization of `AppleTokenPayload` with `is_private_email` as a boolean.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** `AppleSignInDto` updated to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:46:29 AM:** Corrected passing of `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken` in `SocialAuthService`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently revolve around enhancing and securing the **Apple Sign-In** authentication flow. Key patterns include:
*   **Nonce Verification:** Repeated modifications in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts` and `social-auth.service.ts` to correctly implement and utilize nonce verification for Apple ID tokens, which is a critical security practice against replay attacks.
*   **Apple Private Email Relay:** Integration of Apple's `is_private_email` feature by adding it to relevant interfaces and extracting it during the sign-in process.
*   **Interface and DTO Synchronization:** As logic changes were implemented in services, corresponding updates were made to `AppleTokenPayload` (interface for token content), `SocialProfile` (interface for user social data), and `AppleSignInDto` (data transfer object for sign-in requests) to maintain type consistency and data flow.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `Logger` and `UnauthorizedException` for robust error reporting and debugging, particularly for social authentication failures.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple timestamps for the same files within a short period suggest an iterative development process, with frequent saves and minor adjustments to logic and types.
