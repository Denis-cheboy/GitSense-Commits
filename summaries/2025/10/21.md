# Activity Summary for 10/21/2025

## 11:06:44 AM
The `ambulensi-server` project primarily saw updates related to Apple Sign-In functionality within its social authentication module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\providers\apple\apple-token-verifier.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:30:00 AM - 10:31:02 AM:** The `verifyIdToken` method was modified to accept an optional `rawNonce` parameter, and a new private method `verifyNonce` was introduced. This `verifyNonce` method implements SHA256 hashing to compare a nonce from the ID token with a provided raw nonce, which is a crucial security measure for Apple Sign-In. The `crypto` module was imported to support this hashing.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:16 AM:** A minor, transient change was made to use optional chaining (`decoded?.nonce`) when accessing the nonce, which was then reverted almost immediately.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was extended to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, reflecting the token content.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** A new public method `extractEmailFromToken(idToken: string): string | null` was added to facilitate extracting the email directly from the ID token.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:41:09 AM - 10:41:35 AM:** The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was further updated to include an optional `is_private_email?: boolean` property, addressing Apple's private email relay feature.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:37:33 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was refactored for clarity in how the user's email is determined, ensuring it prioritizes the DTO's email, then the token's email, and finally the extracted email.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** The logic for validating the Apple `authorizationCode` was removed from the `handleAppleSignIn` method, suggesting a change in flow or responsibility for this validation.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** The `handleAppleSignIn` method was updated to extract `isPrivateEmail` from the token payload and include it in the `SocialProfile` object.
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:57 AM - 10:46:29 AM:** Adjustments were made in `handleAppleSignIn` regarding how `dto.nonce` is handled. Initially, there was a brief attempt to pass `dto.nonce` to `extractEmailFromToken` (which was incorrect), but this was quickly corrected to pass `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken`, aligning with the nonce verification logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM:** The `SocialProfile` interface was updated to include an optional `isPrivateEmail?: boolean` property, reflecting the information now extracted from Apple ID tokens.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`**
    *   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** The `AppleSignInDto` was enhanced to include an optional `nonce?: string` property, allowing the client to provide the raw nonce for verification.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/21/2025, 10:30:21 AM:** Introduction of the `verifyNonce` method in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:02 AM:** Completion of nonce verification logic with the import of the `crypto` module.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:31:45 AM:** Update of `AppleTokenPayload` to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:36:22 AM:** Addition of `extractEmailFromToken` method.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:38:30 AM:** Removal of `authorizationCode` validation from `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:40:05 AM:** Introduction of `isPrivateEmail` handling in `SocialAuthService`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:41:35 AM:** Finalization of `AppleTokenPayload` with `is_private_email` as a boolean.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:45:04 AM:** `AppleSignInDto` updated to include `nonce`.
*   **10/21/2025, 10:46:29 AM:** Corrected passing of `dto.nonce` to `verifyIdToken` in `SocialAuthService`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently revolve around enhancing and securing the **Apple Sign-In** authentication flow. Key patterns include:
*   **Nonce Verification:** Repeated modifications in `apple-token-verifier.service.ts` and `social-auth.service.ts` to correctly implement and utilize nonce verification for Apple ID tokens, which is a critical security practice against replay attacks.
*   **Apple Private Email Relay:** Integration of Apple's `is_private_email` feature by adding it to relevant interfaces and extracting it during the sign-in process.
*   **Interface and DTO Synchronization:** As logic changes were implemented in services, corresponding updates were made to `AppleTokenPayload` (interface for token content), `SocialProfile` (interface for user social data), and `AppleSignInDto` (data transfer object for sign-in requests) to maintain type consistency and data flow.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `Logger` and `UnauthorizedException` for robust error reporting and debugging, particularly for social authentication failures.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple timestamps for the same files within a short period suggest an iterative development process, with frequent saves and minor adjustments to logic and types.

    *   **10:29:37 AM - 10:31:45 AM**: Introduced nonce verification for Apple ID tokens. This involved modifying the `verifyIdToken` method to accept an optional `rawNonce`, adding a `private verifyNonce` method that hashes the `rawNonce` using the `crypto` module (imported at 10:31:02 AM) and compares it against the token's nonce, and updating the `AppleTokenPayload` interface to include `nonce?: string`.
    *   **10:36:22 AM**: Added an `extractEmailFromToken` utility method to safely retrieve an email address from an Apple ID token.
    *   **10:41:09 AM - 10:41:35 AM**: The `AppleTokenPayload` interface was updated to include an `is_private_email?: boolean` field, reflecting Apple's private email relay service.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\social-auth.service.ts`**
    *   **10:37:33 AM**: The logic within `handleAppleSignIn` for extracting the user's email was refined to prioritize DTO-provided email, then token payload email, and finally the newly added `extractEmailFromToken` utility.
    *   **10:38:30 AM**: The call to `this.validateAppleAuthorizationCode` within `handleAppleSignIn` was removed, suggesting a change in the authorization flow for Apple Sign-In.
    *   **10:40:05 AM**: Implemented logic to extract and include `isPrivateEmail` from the Apple token payload into the `socialProfile`.
    *   **10:45:57 AM - 10:46:29 AM**: The call to `this.appleTokenVerifier.verifyIdToken` in `handleAppleSignIn` was updated to correctly pass the `dto.nonce` for nonce verification. There was a brief, corrected inconsistency where `extractEmailFromToken` was incorrectly passed `dto.nonce` at 10:45:57 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\interfaces\social-profile.interface.ts`**
    *   **10:39:17 AM - 10:41:44 AM**: The `SocialProfile` interface was extended to include an optional `isPrivateEmail` field, initially defined as a string and then corrected to a boolean type.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\auth\social-auth\dtos\apple-signin.dto.ts`**
    *   **10:45:04 AM**: An optional `nonce?: string` property was added to the `AppleSignInDto` to support nonce verification.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\interfaces\onesignal-options.interface.ts`**
    *   **12:47:57 PM**: This file defines various interfaces for OneSignal integration, including `OneSignalModuleOptions`, `NotificationPayload`, and `SendNotificationOptions`, providing structure for push notification configuration and data.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\constants\onesignal.constants.ts`**
    *   **12:49:44 PM**: Defined `ONESIGNAL_CONFIG` constant and enums such as `UserRole` (DRIVER, EMT, ADMIN) and `NotificationType` (e.g., TASK_CREATED, TASK_ASSIGNED, TASK_COMPLETED), crucial for categorizing notifications.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.module.ts`**
    *   **12:51:27 PM - 1:02:22 PM**: The module underwent significant restructuring. It was initially an empty `PushNotificationModule`, then incorporated and renamed a `OneSignalModule` with `forRoot` and `forRootAsync` methods for dynamic configuration. Key changes included renaming the class to `PushNotificationModule` (12:51:37 PM), correcting internal module references (12:52:45 PM), and adjusting import paths for constants (12:52:58 PM) and the service (1:02:22 PM) to reflect the new structure.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\notification\modules\push-notification\push-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **12:54:40 PM - 12:55:28 PM**: This file evolved from an incomplete class declaration to a full `OneSignalService` implementation. This service integrates with `@onesignal/node-onesignal`, providing methods to initialize the client and send various types of notifications (to external user IDs, player IDs, segments, or with filters), as well as to cancel and retrieve notification details. It includes a private `buildNotification` method for constructing OneSignal API payloads.

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\services\task-notification\task-notification.service.ts`**
    *   **1:05:54 PM - 1:06:15 PM**: This new service was created to handle task-related notifications. It defines a `Task` interface and injects the `OneSignalService`. It provides methods to send notifications for various task lifecycle events (e.g., `notifyTaskCreated`, `notifyTaskUpdated`, `notifyTaskCancelled`, `notifyTaskCompleted`, `notifyUrgentTask`), directing them to drivers and/or EMTs. It imports `OneSignalService` at 1:06:00 PM and `NotificationType` at 1:06:15 PM to support its functionality.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Enhanced Social Authentication**: A major theme is the robustification of Apple Sign-In, focusing on security (nonce verification) and feature parity (private email handling).
*   **Push Notification System Integration**: There's a clear effort to introduce and standardize push notifications through OneSignal, building out the core module, service, and relevant interfaces/constants.
*   **Modular NestJS Architecture**: The changes consistently follow NestJS patterns, using `@Injectable()`, `@Module()`, dependency injection, and logger instances for each service.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: `Logger` instances are extensively used across services (`this.logger.log`, `this.logger.error`) within `try...catch` blocks, indicating a focus on operational visibility and graceful error recovery.
*   **Rapid Development and Refinement**: The timestamp progression shows quick iterations, with fixes for import paths and minor code inconsistencies appearing rapidly after initial implementations.
