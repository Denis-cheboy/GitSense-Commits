# Activity Summary for 10/20/2025

## 12:59:45 PM
The file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\resources\js\pages\FAQ.vue` underwent a series of structured changes, primarily focusing on layout refactoring, UI consistency, and script organization.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Initial Setup (10/20/2025, 12:44:22 PM):** The component's script was initialized with comprehensive FAQ data, categorized questions, and support for rich media content (images, videos, downloadable attachments) within answers. It imported numerous UI components from `@/components/ui/` and Lucide icons, along with layout components like `Header`, `AdminNavigation`, and `Footer`. Core reactive state for search, category filtering, and an admin add dialog was established.
*   **Template Integration (10/20/2025, 12:44:37 PM):** The accompanying template was introduced, defining the full FAQ page layout. This included a search bar, dynamic category filters, conditional display of admin actions (like "Add FAQ"), an accordion structure for questions and answers, and a dedicated "Still Need Help" section with contact details.
*   **Script/Template Ordering (10/20/2025, 12:44:46 PM):** A minor internal reorganization moved the `<script setup>` block to appear after the `<template>` block.
*   **Layout Component Integration (10/20/2025, 12:47:21 PM - 12:47:38 PM):** The page was refactored to utilize an `AppLayout` component. Initially, an incorrect wrapping was introduced, almost rendering an empty page, but this was swiftly corrected to properly nest the entire FAQ page content within the `<AppLayout>` tags.
*   **Layout Component Consolidation (10/20/2025, 12:48:11 PM):** The `Header` and `AdminNavigation` components were removed directly from the `FAQ.vue` template, indicating that `AppLayout` now manages these elements centrally. The `Footer` component remained in this page's template.
*   **UI Button Sizing Adjustments (10/20/2025, 12:48:40 PM - 12:49:07 PM):** Multiple UI `Button` components used for category filtering and clearing filters had their `size` attribute updated from `xs` (extra small) to `sm` (small) for enhanced visual consistency.
*   **Script Cleanup and Refactoring (10/20/2025, 12:49:26 PM - 12:49:41 PM):**
    *   Imports for `Header`, `AdminNavigation`, and `Footer` were removed from the `<script setup>` block, aligning with their removal from the template.
    *   The import path for `useToast` was updated from `@/components/ui/toast` to `@/composables/useToast`, indicating a move of this utility into a dedicated composables directory.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/20/2025, 12:44:22 PM:** Initial robust data and script foundation.
*   **10/20/2025, 12:44:37 PM:** Introduction of the complete template structure.
*   **10/20/2025, 12:47:38 PM:** Successful integration of the `AppLayout` component, correcting an earlier partial implementation.
*   **10/20/2025, 12:48:11 PM:** Refactoring of layout components (`Header`, `AdminNavigation`) into `AppLayout`.
*   **10/20/2025, 12:48:40 PM to 12:49:07 PM:** Consistent UI styling updates across multiple buttons.
*   **10/20/2025, 12:49:26 PM & 12:49:41 PM:** Script cleanup and structural import path change.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Progressive Refactoring:** The changes show a clear pattern of evolving the component's architecture, especially in how global layout elements are handled, moving from explicit imports and usage within the component to centralization in a parent `AppLayout`.
*   **UI/UX Refinement:** Consistent updates to button sizes (from `xs` to `sm`) indicate an ongoing effort to standardize the user interface and improve the user experience.
*   **Modularization:** The shift of `useToast` to a `composables` directory suggests a move towards a more modular and organized codebase, separating UI components from reusable logic.
*   **Rich Content Support:** The extensive `faqList` with embedded media demonstrates an initial design that supports detailed and interactive answers for users.
