# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

The file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\site\contact.php` was last modified on 10/28/2025, 7:56:01 PM.

This PHP file appears to manage a "Contact" module within an RFD (Registered Firearms Dealer) application, handling both data entry and integration with other system components.

Key updates and features include:

*   **Print Functionality**: Specific CSS rules are defined for printing, ensuring a landscape layout, page breaks before the contact tabs, hiding navigation elements, and zooming the content to 85%. This suggests a requirement for physical printouts of contact information.
*   **Session-based Transaction Management**: The code extensively uses PHP sessions (`$_SESSION['new_contact']`, `$_SESSION['edit_contact']`) to manage multi-step processes for creating or editing contacts when they are part of a larger transaction (e.g., "Gun", "Ammo", "Multiple Book Out"). It detects if a user is "in the middle of a transaction," sets appropriate redirect URLs and notification messages, and customizes "Cancel" and "Create/Edit" button texts based on the transaction type.
*   **Security and Redirection**: It includes `site_globals.php`, performs a user sign-in check, and redirects `client_id == 1` to a different client-specific page, suggesting client-specific access control.
*   **Database Interaction Configuration**: A set of `$inp_` variables are used to configure generic database operations for the `contact` table. This includes defining the primary key (`contact_id`), order by clause (`contact_LastName, contact_FirstName`), extra `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses (linking to `site_user` and filtering by `client_id` and `contact_status`), and automatically populating `contact_created/updated` timestamps and user/client IDs.
*   **EPOS Integration**: A specific action `SEND_CONTACT_EPOS` allows sending contact details to an EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) system if the client has the EPOS option enabled.
*   **Form Field Definitions (`$Ainp` array)**: A detailed `$Ainp` array defines the various input fields for a contact. This pattern allows for flexible configuration of field properties such as prompt, type (e.g., "autocomplete", "multicheckbox", "telephone", "hidden"), size, maximum length, colspan, tab index, and custom JavaScript validation (e.g., requiring either first/last name or an organization name). `autocomplete="off"` is consistently used for name and address fields.
*   **Search Functionality**: The contact search offers a toggle between "simple" and "detailed" search modes. The simple search allows searching across concatenated fields (first name, last name, postcode, organization name) from a single input box.
*   **Print Button**: A `local_print_button` function is defined to generate an HTML `<a>` tag, enabling the printing of contact labels.

Recurring elements include the use of `site_create_notification` for user feedback, dynamic button text adjustments based on context, and a consistent pattern of defining input fields and their properties within the `$Ainp` associative array. The timestamp suggests this is a recent or future update to the system.
