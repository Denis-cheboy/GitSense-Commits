# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 12:15:17 PM
The `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\database\seeders\DatabaseSeeder.php` file was updated in two quick successive changes on **11/28/2025**.

The initial update at **12:12:55 PM** introduced or modified the `DatabaseSeeder` to create a single `Test User` with the email `test@example.com`. This version contained a minor syntax error in the `run` method signature (`public function run(): void, {`).

A subsequent change, just nine seconds later at **12:13:04 PM**, rectified this syntax error by removing the extraneous comma from the `run` method signature, changing it to `public function run(): void {`.

Across both updates, the file's primary function remained consistent: to seed the database with a single predefined test user. Both versions also included a commented-out line indicating a previous or alternative approach to create multiple users using `User::factory(10)->create()`.
