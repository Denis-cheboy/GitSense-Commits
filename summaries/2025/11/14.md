# Activity Summary for 11/14/2025

## 11:43:13 AM
The `UserRepository.php` file, located at `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\app\Repositories\UserRepository.php` and last modified on `11/14/2025, 10:44:59 AM`, defines a comprehensive repository for managing `User` models.

Key updates and functionalities in this file include:
*   **CRUD Operations**: Standard `create`, `find`, `update`, and `delete` methods for `User` models are implemented.
*   **Data Retrieval**:
    *   `all()`: Retrieves all users using a `LazyCollection`, eager loading the `client` relationship and ordering by latest.
    *   `paginate($data)`: Provides paginated user data with flexible filtering options, including a multi-field search across `firstname`, `lastname`, `username`, `email`, and `display_name`. It also supports filtering by `shop_id` (mapped to `client_id`) and `status`. The `client` relationship is consistently eager loaded.
    *   `findByStatus(string $status)`: Fetches users based on a specific status, also eager loading `client` and ordering by latest.
    *   `search(string $term)`: Offers a dedicated search method across multiple user fields (`firstname`, `lastname`, `username`, `email`, `display_name`), eager loading `client` and ordering by latest.
*   **Bulk Actions**: A `bulkUpdateStatus(array $ids, string $status)` method is included to efficiently update the status for multiple users simultaneously.

A recurring pattern observed is the consistent eager loading of the `client` relationship in almost all retrieval methods (`all`, `paginate`, `find`, `findByStatus`, `search`), suggesting that user data is frequently displayed or processed alongside their associated client information. The methods `paginate` and `search` both implement similar multi-field `LIKE` based search logic, indicating a robust search capability for user records.
