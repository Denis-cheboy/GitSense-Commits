# Activity Summary for 11/6/2025

## 10:45:11 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively within the file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\dennis-consultancy\src\components\SoftwareConsultancy.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The core content of `SoftwareConsultancy.jsx` is a React component that integrates several modern front-end technologies:
*   **3D Graphics:** It utilizes `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to render interactive 3D elements like a `FloatingCube` and `AnimatedSphere` within a `Scene3D` canvas, complete with ambient and point lights, and stars. `OrbitControls` are enabled for user interaction, though zoom and pan are disabled.
*   **Animations:** `framer-motion` is employed for text morphing animations, specifically in the `MorphingText` component which cycles through words with a fade and slide effect.
*   **Icons:** `lucide-react` provides a wide array of icons used throughout the component's data sections.
*   **Email Service:** `emailjs` is imported, suggesting functionality for sending emails directly from the client-side.
*   **Data Sections:** The component structure includes various data arrays to populate sections like:
    *   `stats`: Key performance indicators.
    *   `services`: Detailed descriptions of consulting services with features.
    *   `whyChooseUs`: Reasons to choose the consultancy.
    *   `process`: An outline of the project methodology.
    *   `testimonials`: Client feedback.
    *   `faqs`: Frequently asked questions.

The only observed content change across all log entries pertains to the `stats` array. Initially, at `11/6/2025, 10:30:07 AM`, the `stats` array listed "12+ Projects Completed" and "40+ Happy Clients". By `11/6/2025, 10:30:17 AM`, these numbers were revised downwards to "10+ Projects Completed" and "15+ Happy Clients".

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **11/6/2025, 10:30:07 AM:** Initial state of the `stats` array.
*   **11/6/2025, 10:30:17 AM:** A significant update occurred where the values for "Projects Completed" and "Happy Clients" in the `stats` array were modified.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Modification:** The same file, `SoftwareConsultancy.jsx`, is the subject of every log entry.
*   **Repetitive Saves/Minimal Changes:** After the initial statistical data adjustment at 10:30:17 AM, the code content for `SoftwareConsultancy.jsx` remained identical for all subsequent logged changes up until 10:42:19 AM. This suggests a period of continuous saving without further code alterations in this file, or possibly minor, unlogged changes that did not affect the visible diff.
*   **Structured Data:** The component heavily relies on structured JavaScript arrays of objects (`stats`, `services`, `whyChooseUs`, `process`, `testimonials`, `faqs`) to populate its content, indicating a modular and data-driven approach to content management.
