# Activity Summary for 11/10/2025

## 10:30:29 AM
For the file `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`:

The file `ems-sop.service.ts` at `11/10/2025, 9:33:17 AM` and `11/10/2025, 9:33:34 AM` shows the initial implementation of the `EmsSopService`. This service, written in TypeScript with NestJS, handles Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for EMS, interacting with a Back4app backend using the Parse SDK. It includes methods for:
*   `findAll`: Retrieving all EMS SOPs with support for search by `sopName`, status, and category, as well as pagination and sorting.
*   `findOne`: Fetching a single SOP by its ID.
*   `findByStatus`, `searchByName`, `findByCategory`: Specialized methods for retrieving SOPs based on specific criteria.
*   Internal mapping functions (`mapToDto`, `mapFileToDto`) to convert Parse objects into DTOs.
At this stage, the service primarily uses `sopName` for the name field and `file` for the file object within the Back4app collection. The second timestamp `11/10/2025, 9:33:34 AM` shows no functional changes, indicating a save or reformat without code modification.

A significant update occurred at `11/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM`. This update primarily focused on adjusting the service to correctly reference field names within the Back4app schema.
The key changes include:
*   **Search Filters:** The search logic in `findAll` and `searchByName` methods was updated to query the `name` field instead of `sopName` (e.g., `query.matches('name', searchRegex)`).
*   **DTO Mapping:** The `mapToDto` function was modified to retrieve the SOP name from `parseObject.get('name')` (previously `sopName`) and the file object from `parseObject.get('faFile')` (previously `file`).
*   **Comments:** New comments like `// Back4app uses 'name' field` and `// Back4app uses 'faFile'` were added to clarify the field name alignment with the Back4app backend.

**Pattern of changes:** The recurring theme across the changes is an explicit adaptation of the `EmsSopService` to match specific field names (`name` for `sopName`, `faFile` for `file`) used in the external Back4app data model, ensuring correct data retrieval and mapping.

## 11:23:29 AM
The provided log primarily details changes to a PHP file named `server.txt`, located at `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\server.txt`. The changes focus on implementing and enhancing a "search on site gone" feature for managing gun records.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\server.txt`**

*   **11/10/2025, 10:43:00 AM - 10:43:27 AM**: Initial changes introduced a default value of 'ONSITE' for the `search_on_site_gone` parameter if it's not set. This also included a backward compatibility fix to convert an old 'GONE' status to 'GONE_ALL'. These initial entries vary slightly only in their "line" annotation.
*   **11/10/2025, 10:44:21 AM**: A significant block of code was added to handle `SEARCHLIST` requests. This expanded the `search_on_site_gone` logic by:
    *   Clearing the `lastpk` for new searches.
    *   Preseting the order of various gun-related search fields (`gun_StockNumber`, `gun_Type`, `gun_Model`, etc.) if `simple_searchlist` is enabled.
    *   Implementing a `switch` statement to dynamically modify the SQL `WHERE` clause (`$inp_extra_where`) based on the `search_on_site_gone` value. New statuses like 'ALL', 'ONSITE', 'GONE' (or 'GONE_ALL'), 'GONE_RECENT' (guns from last 6 years), and 'GONE_ARCHIVE' (guns older than 6 years) were defined with specific date-based conditions.
    *   Adding further `WHERE` clauses for `export_id`, `contact_in_id`, and `contact_out_id`.
    *   Introducing `gun_isGone` to assign a CSS class ('gungone') to rows representing guns that have an `outDate` set, indicating they are "gone".
*   **11/10/2025, 10:46:54 AM**: This update introduced the client-side UI component for the "search on site gone" feature. A new section of code was added to generate an HTML `<select>` dropdown element (`id="search_on_site_gone"`). This dropdown includes:
    *   Options for 'All' and 'On site'.
    *   An `<optgroup>` labeled "Gone" containing sub-options: 'All Gone', 'Recent (Last 6 Years)', and 'Archive (6+ Years Ago)', mirroring the backend logic. The currently selected option is pre-marked.
*   **11/10/2025, 10:51:06 AM**: The final change in this file added JavaScript (jQuery) event handlers for the newly created dropdowns. Specifically:
    *   An `onChange` event handler for `#search_on_site_gone` was added, which logs the change and redirects the browser to a `SEARCHLIST` URL, passing the selected "onsite" value.
    *   An `onChange` event handler for `#export_id` was also added, similarly redirecting to a `SEARCHLIST` URL with the selected `export_id`.
    *   Minor log messages for debugging were included (`console.log`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature-driven Development**: The changes show a clear progression of developing a single feature ("search on site gone") from backend logic to UI and client-side interaction.
*   **PHP Context**: The code uses PHP arrays (`$Auser`, `$Ainp`), superglobals (`$_REQUEST`, `$_SESSION`), and string concatenation for SQL queries (`$inp_extra_where`).
*   **Backward Compatibility**: An explicit comment and code block addresses backward compatibility for a status change.
*   **Date-based Filtering**: The "gone" filtering options (`GONE_RECENT`, `GONE_ARCHIVE`) rely on SQL date functions like `curdate()`, `DATE_SUB`, and `INTERVAL`.
*   **Line Annotations**: Early entries for `server.txt` include "line" or "starting line" annotations which were then dropped in larger code blocks.

No summary is provided for file paths containing sensitive information such as API keys or passwords, as per instructions.

## 11:30:27 AM
The provided log primarily details changes within a single file: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`**: This `EmsSopService` is responsible for managing EMS Standard Operating Procedures, interacting with a Back4app backend.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/10/2025, 9:33:17 AM and 11/10/2025, 9:33:34 AM**: These two entries show identical code, indicating a save operation or minor non-functional change without altering the core logic.
*   **11/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM**: This timestamp marks the only functional update to the file. The key changes are:
    *   In the `findAll` and `searchByName` methods, the search filter field was changed from `sopName` to `name` in the Back4app query. Comments were added to clarify that "Back4app uses 'name' field."
    *   In the `mapToDto` private method, the service now retrieves the file object using `parseObject.get('faFile')` instead of `parseObject.get('file')`. Similarly, the `sopName` property in the DTO is now mapped from `parseObject.get('name')` instead of `parseObject.get('sopName')`. New comments explicitly state "Back4app uses 'faFile'" and "Back4app uses 'name'".
    *   A general comment was added to `mapToDto`: "// Map Back4app field names to our DTO field names".

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is the adjustment of field names within the service to align with the conventions of the Back4app backend. Specifically, `sopName` was updated to `name` and `file` was updated to `faFile` when interacting with Back4app queries and objects. This suggests a reconciliation of the internal DTO structure with the external data source's schema. All methods consistently use logging for successful operations and error handling.

## 12:23:41 PM
Changes in the codebase are concentrated on November 10, 2025, primarily within two files: `server.txt` and `guntest.php`/`site\gun.php`.

For `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\server.txt`:
- **11/10/2025, 10:43:00 AM - 10:43:27 AM**: An initial code snippet at line 750 was introduced and subsequently clarified in logging. This code ensures that a `search_on_site_gone` user preference defaults to 'ONSITE' and provides backward compatibility by converting an old 'GONE' status to 'GONE_ALL'.
- **11/10/2025, 10:44:21 AM**: Significant search functionality was added at line 850. This update expands the `SEARCHLIST` action to include complex `WHERE` clause generation based on `search_on_site_gone` states (ALL, ONSITE, GONE_ALL, GONE_RECENT, GONE_ARCHIVE, which filters guns by their `inDate` and `outDate`). It also incorporates filtering by `export_id`, `contact_in_id`, and `contact_out_id`, and adds logic to assign a 'gungone' CSS class to rows representing gone guns.
- **11/10/2025, 10:46:54 AM**: User interface elements for the new search were added at line 2404. This involved creating an HTML dropdown (`<select>`) for the `search_on_site_gone` option, featuring grouped options for "All", "On site", and "Gone" (with sub-options for "All Gone", "Recent", and "Archive").
- **11/10/2025, 10:51:06 AM**: Client-side interactivity was implemented at line 4934. This JavaScript (jQuery) code adds `onChange` event handlers for both the `search_on_site_gone` and `export_id` dropdowns, triggering page redirects to update search results based on user selections.

For `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\guntest.php`:
- **11/10/2025, 10:57:19 AM**: This file was added or significantly updated. It contains extensive PHP code for gun management, including:
    - Conditional CSS for printing search lists in landscape.
    - Inclusion of global settings and JavaScript for row highlighting.
    - A `sendNewValuesEmail` function to notify about new gun make/model/calibre values, fetching data from an external API. This function uses PHPMailer, with its SMTP configuration initially commented out in this version.
    - Core application setup for database interactions (table, primary keys, ordering, join clauses, `WHERE` conditions for client-specific guns and transfer status).
    - Logic for various actions such as redirecting to the last viewed record, duplicating guns (including serial number processing and notifications), and assembling new guns from parts (generating new stock numbers, contact handling, and creating new gun entries).

For `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\rfdregister\site\gun.php`:
- **11/10/2025, 10:59:45 AM - 11:17:49 AM**: This file, functionally similar to `guntest.php`, was created or repeatedly modified during this period. It contains sensitive API keys, specifically a SendGrid SMTP password, hardcoded within the `sendNewValuesEmail` function's PHPMailer configuration. As per instructions, the detailed content of this file will not be summarized due to the presence of sensitive keys.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Focused Search Enhancements:** A prominent pattern is the incremental development of gun search functionality in `server.txt`, moving from basic default settings to complex SQL filtering and finally to interactive UI controls and client-side scripting.
- **Email Notification System:** Both `guntest.php` and `site\gun.php` feature a `sendNewValuesEmail` function using PHPMailer, indicating a consistent approach to alerting about new gun data.
- **Sensitive Data Handling:** The presence of hardcoded API keys in `site\gun.php` across multiple timestamps highlights a recurring (and insecure) practice of embedding credentials directly into the source code.
- **Rapid Development Cycle:** All recorded changes occurred on the same date within a span of roughly 35 minutes, suggesting an intensive period of development or integration.

## 12:30:29 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates for `ems-sop.service.ts`:**

The initial two log entries (11/10/2025, 9:33:17 AM and 11/10/2025, 9:33:34 AM) show identical content, indicating no functional change between these two points in time.

A significant update occurred at **11/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM**, which involved refactoring the service to align with specific Back4app field names:

*   **`findAll` method:** The search filter logic was updated to query the `'name'` field instead of `'sopName'` when applying a search term (e.g., `query.matches('name', searchRegex)`). A comment was added to clarify, "Back4app uses 'name' field."
*   **`searchByName` method:** Similarly, the search query for finding SOPs by name was changed from `query.matches('sopName', searchRegex)` to `query.matches('name', searchRegex)`, also with an explanatory comment, "Back4app uses 'name'."
*   **`mapToDto` private method:**
    *   The field used to retrieve the file object was changed from `'file'` to `'faFile'` (e.g., `parseObject.get('faFile')`).
    *   The field for the SOP name was changed from `'sopName'` to `'name'` (e.g., `sopName: parseObject.get('name') || ''`).
    *   Comments were added to both changes within `mapToDto` to specify, "Back4app uses 'faFile'" and "Back4app uses 'name'".
*   The comment `// Change this to match your Back4app collection name` next to `private readonly COLLECTION_NAME = 'EMSSOPs';` was removed, suggesting that `EMSSOPs` is the confirmed collection name.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is the consistent adaptation of field names within the `EmsSopService` to match the underlying Back4app data model. Specifically, the fields `sopName` and `file` were updated to `name` and `faFile` respectively, across multiple methods (`findAll`, `searchByName`, `mapToDto`). This indicates a systematic effort to ensure data retrieval and mapping functions correctly with the Back4app backend's schema. All changes occurred within a short time frame on the same date.

## 1:57:38 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp 11/10/2025, 9:33:17 AM** and **11/10/2025, 9:33:34 AM**: These two entries show virtually identical code. There are no functional changes between them, suggesting minor saves or reformatting without substantive code modification. The service initially queries `sopName` for search and uses a `file` field for file attachments.
    *   **Timestamp 11/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM**: This entry introduces significant changes to align the service with specific Back4app backend field names.
        *   In the `findAll` and `searchByName` methods, the search query field for the SOP's name was changed from `sopName` to `name`.
        *   In the `mapToDto` method, the field used to retrieve the SOP's name was changed from `sopName` to `name`, and the field for file attachments was changed from `file` to `faFile`.
        *   Comments were added to clarify these changes, explicitly stating "Back4app uses 'name'" or "Back4app uses 'faFile'".

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The most significant update occurred at **11/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM**, where the service's data access logic was modified to accommodate Back4app's field naming conventions. The earlier timestamps at 9:33:17 AM and 9:33:34 AM show the initial state of the code and an immediate, non-functional save, respectively.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Adaptation to Back4app Field Names**: The primary pattern is the explicit modification of field names in database queries and DTO mapping to match an assumed "Back4app" schema. Specifically, `sopName` was replaced with `name`, and `file` was replaced with `faFile`.
*   **Consistency in Method Structure**: Across all versions, the methods (`findAll`, `findOne`, `findByStatus`, `searchByName`, `findByCategory`) maintain a consistent structure: building a `Parse.Query` object, applying filters/sorting/pagination, executing the query with `useMasterKey: true`, mapping results to DTOs, and logging success or error.
*   **Error Handling and Logging**: All service methods include `try-catch` blocks for robust error handling and use a `Logger` instance to log operational messages and errors, including stack traces for errors.
*   **DTO Mapping Logic**: The `mapToDto` and `mapFileToDto` private methods are crucial for transforming `Parse.Object` instances into the application's DTOs, handling potential missing fields and differentiating between `Parse.File` objects and plain file objects.

## 2:58:00 PM
**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\ems-sop\ems-sop.service.ts`**
*   **Timestamp:** The changes occurred between 11/10/2025, 9:33:17 AM and 9:57:09 AM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   The service was refactored to align with specific Back4app field names.
    *   Search operations (`findAll` and `searchByName` methods) were updated to query the `name` field instead of `sopName`.
    *   Data mapping in `mapToDto` was adjusted to retrieve the SOP name from `parseObject.get('name')` and the associated file from `parseObject.get('faFile')`, indicating a change in the backend data structure or API contract.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-dev.yaml`**
*   **Timestamp:** A series of rapid updates occurred between 11/10/2025, 2:06:43 PM and 2:10:58 PM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   Multiple environment variables related to Back4app integration were incrementally added to the Cloud Build configuration for the development environment. Specifically, `BACK4APP_APP_ID`, `BACK4APP_JS_KEY`, and `BACK4APP_SERVER_URL` were introduced.
    *   The `BACK4APP_SERVER_URL` was initially added as an empty string and then updated to `"https://parseapi.back4app.com"`.
*   **Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
    *   Environment variables are consistently written to `/workspace/secrets.yaml` and then used for deploying to Cloud Run via `--env-vars-file`.
    *   There were transient duplicate entries for `BACK4APP_APP_ID` and `BACK4APP_JS_KEY` in the `secrets.yaml` generation script before the final state.
    *   Many key environment variables like `MONGODB_URI`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`, and various support emails are configured via substitutions.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-prod.yaml`**
*   **Timestamp:** Updates occurred between 11/10/2025, 2:11:14 PM and 2:11:46 PM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   The Cloud Build configuration for the production environment was updated to include `BACK4APP_APP_ID`, `BACK4APP_JS_KEY`, and `BACK4APP_SERVER_URL`, mirroring the additions made to the development configuration.
*   **Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
    *   Similar to the development configuration, this file sets up production-specific URLs, project IDs, bucket names, and service accounts.
    *   The `BACK4APP` related keys and URL were added in a single commit, in contrast to the more incremental updates in the dev configuration.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\cloudbuild-test.yaml`**
*   **Timestamp:** Updates occurred between 11/10/2025, 2:12:08 PM and 2:12:49 PM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   The Cloud Build configuration for the test environment was updated to include `BACK4APP_APP_ID`, `BACK4APP_JS_KEY`, and `BACK4APP_SERVER_URL`, consistent with the dev and prod environments.
*   **Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
    *   This file configures test-specific URLs, project IDs, bucket names, and service accounts.
    *   A noticeable pattern of copy-paste errors exists, where `CELCOM_BASE_URL` is repeatedly used as the key for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` when writing to `secrets.yaml`. This indicates a potential misconfiguration that persists across the updates.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\task.module.ts`**
*   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes occurred between 11/10/2025, 2:37:17 PM and 2:43:43 PM, showing a fluctuating state.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   Initially, `OneSignalModule` and `IncidentModule` (with `forwardRef`) were imported.
    *   `OneSignalModule` was temporarily commented out, and `IncidentModule` was briefly imported directly (without `forwardRef`), suggesting dependency resolution or circular dependency issues were being investigated.
    *   The module then reverted to importing `OneSignalModule` and `IncidentModule` using `forwardRef`, indicating these dependencies were necessary.
    *   A brief state existed where several modules (`forwardRef`, `TaskNotificationService`, `IncidentModule`, `OneSignalModule`) were removed from imports and providers, and `WebsocketGateway` was imported (though not used), indicating a significant refactoring attempt or cleanup.
    *   Ultimately, the module returned to its previous state, including `WebsocketModule`, `OneSignalModule`, `forwardRef(() => IncidentModule)`, and `TaskNotificationService` as imports and providers.

**File: `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\task.ts`**
*   **Timestamp:** This file appeared at 11/10/2025, 2:41:25 PM and was emptied at 2:43:04 PM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   This file briefly existed as an exact duplicate of `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\ambulensi\ambulensi-server\src\task\task.module.ts` (at its state at 2:41:06 PM), suggesting it was either a temporary file created during development or a misplacement, before being cleared.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   There's a strong focus on integration with the Back4app backend, evident from the `ems-sop.service.ts` changes to field mapping and the addition of `BACK4APP_APP_ID`, `BACK4APP_JS_KEY`, and `BACK4APP_SERVER_URL` across all `cloudbuild` configurations (dev, prod, test).
*   Deployment configurations (`cloudbuild-*.yaml`) are being consistently updated to include new secrets/environment variables for external services, often with rapid, incremental commits for each new variable.
*   Development efforts in the `task.module.ts` indicate ongoing adjustments to module dependencies, particularly concerning `IncidentModule` and `OneSignalModule`, suggesting complex inter-module relationships or refactoring.
*   The `task.ts` file briefly existing as a copy and then being emptied suggests a temporary file creation or a refactoring artifact.
*   The timestamps indicate two distinct bursts of activity: one in the morning (around 9:30 AM) for the `ems-sop` service, and a much longer, more active period in the afternoon (around 2:00 PM onwards) for infrastructure configuration (`cloudbuild`) and `task` module changes.
