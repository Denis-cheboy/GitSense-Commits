The `weapon-models-list.tsx` file, last updated on `11/18/2025, 11:44:02 AM`, is a React component designed for managing and displaying a list of weapon models.

**Key Changes and Functionality:**

*   **Extensive UI Component Integration:** The file imports numerous UI components from `@/components/ui` such as `Button`, `Input`, `Table`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Badge`, `Pagination`, and `AlertDialog`, indicating a rich user interface for data management.
*   **Icon Usage:** Several Lucide React icons (`Plus`, `Search`, `Pencil`, `Trash2`, `FileDown`, `FileSpreadsheet`, `CheckCircle2`, `XCircle`) are imported for visual actions within the UI.
*   **Mock Data Generation:** It includes a `generateMockModels` function that creates 201 realistic-looking `WeaponModel` entries using predefined arrays for makes, models, categories, calibres, and action types. This suggests the component is designed to be fully functional on the frontend with or without a backend connection initially.
*   **State Management:** The component uses `useState` extensively to manage various aspects of the UI and data, including:
    *   `models`: The primary array of weapon models.
    *   `searchQuery`, `categoryFilter`, `calibreFilter`, `statusFilter`: For filtering the displayed models.
    *   `currentPage`: For pagination control.
    *   `dialogOpen`, `editingModel`, `deleteDialogOpen`, `modelToDelete`: For managing "Add/Edit" and "Delete" dialogs.
    *   `selectedIds`: For handling bulk actions.
*   **CRUD Operations & Bulk Actions:**
    *   **Add/Edit:** `handleAddNew`, `handleEdit`, and `handleSaveModel` functions facilitate adding new weapon models or updating existing ones.
    *   **Delete:** `handleDeleteClick` and `handleDeleteConfirm` manage the deletion process with an `AlertDialog` for confirmation.
    *   **Toggle Active Status:** `handleToggleActive` allows changing the `activeOnWebsite` and `activeOnRegister` status for individual models.
    *   **Bulk Activate/Deactivate:** `handleBulkActivate` and `handleBulkDeactivate` provide functionality to change the active status for multiple selected models.
*   **Filtering, Searching, and Pagination:**
    *   Models can be searched by make, model, or description using `searchQuery`.
    *   Filters are available for `category`, `calibre`, and `status` (active/inactive).
    *   `filteredModels` and `paginatedModels` computations handle the filtering and pagination logic, displaying 10 items per page.
*   **Data Export:**
    *   `handleExportCSV` and `handleExportExcel` functions are implemented to export the currently filtered model data into CSV and Excel formats, utilizing external `export-utils`.
*   **User Feedback:** `toast` notifications from `sonner` are used to provide feedback for successful operations like model deletion, status updates, and data exports.
*   **Component Structure:** The component renders a header with a title and description, action buttons (Export, Add Model), search and filter controls, a data table with interactive elements (checkboxes, edit/delete buttons, status toggles), and pagination controls.
