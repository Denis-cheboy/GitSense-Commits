# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 2:08:51 PM
The primary changes observed relate to the `app/composables/useParse.ts` file, with a significant timestamp of 11/4/2025, 1:19:10 PM.

This file introduces a `useParse` composable, which provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities for user authentication and management within the application, built upon the Parse SDK. Key features and updates include:

*   **Authentication Flow:** Implementation of `initAuth` for initial authentication state setup, `login` (including a check for `accountStatus` to ensure the account is active), `signup`, and `logout` functions.
*   **User Management:** Capabilities for `requestPasswordReset`, `updateProfile`, and `changePassword` for existing users.
*   **Reactive State Management:** Utilizes Nuxt's `useState` to maintain reactive states for the current user (`authState.user`), authentication status (`authState.isAuthenticated`), loading status (`authState.isLoading`), and admin privileges (`isAdmin`).
*   **Authorization:** Includes functions like `hasRole` to check for specific Parse roles and `checkIfIsAdmin` which specifically sets the `isAdmin` state based on a user's `role` attribute being 'admin'. `getUserACL` is also provided.
*   **Error Handling:** Each asynchronous operation consistently uses `try...catch` blocks to manage potential errors, returning clear `success` and `error` messages.
*   **Data Structures:** Defines `ParseUser` and `AuthState` interfaces for type safety.

A recurring pattern across the changes is the heavy reliance on the Parse SDK for all user-related operations, coupled with Nuxt's composable pattern and `useState` for reactive state management. All these changes appear to be part of a concentrated effort, as indicated by the very close timestamps for the relevant file.
