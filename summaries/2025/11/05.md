# Activity Summary for 11/5/2025

## 12:42:11 PM
In `c:\Users\Dennis\Documents\projects\GunRegister\app\Http\Controllers\Admin\UserController.php`, updated on November 5, 2025, at 12:21:16 PM, the `UserController` class defines an `index` method for displaying a list of users in an admin interface. This method incorporates advanced filtering capabilities, allowing users to search by `firstname`, `lastname`, `username`, or `email`, filter by `shop` (`client_id`), and filter by `status`. It fetches user data, eagerly loading related client information (`User::with('client')`), and orders the results by `created_at` in descending order. The controller also retrieves a list of all available clients (`shops`) to populate a filter dropdown, mapping their IDs and display names. The filtered users and shop data are then rendered using Inertia to the `admin/Users` view, with users transformed into a `UserResource::collection`.
