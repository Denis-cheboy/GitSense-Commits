## 12:28:40
The log shows modifications to environment variables within a `.env` file.  The primary changes relate to database connection URLs, which shift between different MongoDB instances (e.g., `localhost`,  `internalnhr.mt6pj.mongodb.net` with varying usernames and databases).  There are also adjustments to various API keys (SendGrid, JWT), URLs for different services (e.g., Etisalat messaging, Okta SSO), and application settings (e.g., login attempts, 2FA configuration, expiration times for tokens).  The timestamp for these changes is 22/04/2025, 11:36:55.  The configuration includes settings for AWS secrets, indicating integration with AWS services.  The `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` variable is set to `https://payroll.nathanhr.ae`, controlling allowed origins for cross-origin requests.  Finally, there are settings for Okta SSO integration, specifically for Schonfeld, implying the application is configured for production use with an Okta-managed authentication system.  The `UI_URL` and `REDIRECT_URI` point to different domains (`payroll.nathanhr.com` and `payrollapi.nathanhr.com`), suggesting a separate UI and API deployment.
