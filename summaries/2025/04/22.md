# Activity Summary for 22/04/2025

## 12:28:40
The log shows modifications to environment variables within a `.env` file.  The primary changes relate to database connection URLs, which shift between different MongoDB instances (e.g., `localhost`,  `internalnhr.mt6pj.mongodb.net` with varying usernames and databases).  There are also adjustments to various API keys (SendGrid, JWT), URLs for different services (e.g., Etisalat messaging, Okta SSO), and application settings (e.g., login attempts, 2FA configuration, expiration times for tokens).  The timestamp for these changes is 22/04/2025, 11:36:55.  The configuration includes settings for AWS secrets, indicating integration with AWS services.  The `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` variable is set to `https://payroll.nathanhr.ae`, controlling allowed origins for cross-origin requests.  Finally, there are settings for Okta SSO integration, specifically for Schonfeld, implying the application is configured for production use with an Okta-managed authentication system.  The `UI_URL` and `REDIRECT_URI` point to different domains (`payroll.nathanhr.com` and `payrollapi.nathanhr.com`), suggesting a separate UI and API deployment.

The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file between 12:29:25 PM and 12:50:26 PM on April 22, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on refinements to the UI rather than core functionality.  There are no significant structural alterations to the code.  The code consistently features Vue.js components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-tooltip`, `v-img`, `v-avatar`, `v-alert`, `v-textarea`, `v-chip`, `v-menu`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`) indicating the use of the Vuetify framework for building the user interface.  The code manages the display and interaction of buttons for approving, rejecting, submitting for approval, and closing payroll sheets.  It also handles displaying approval status and comments, and provides functionalities for downloading various reports such as bank files, SIF files (with variations for different formats like 'format 2 Lulu'), and a Journal Voucher sheet.  The repeated edits suggest debugging or small adjustments to the layout and conditional rendering within the UI based on the `payrollprocesses` data.
