# Activity Summary for 17/04/2025

## 11:44:14
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hitachi-gts-mcs-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` file, last updated on 17/04/2025 at 10:44:14, contains a comprehensive set of asynchronous functions related to payroll processing.  These functions interact with various MongoDB models (`PayrollProcess`, `Requests`, `User`, `Configuration`, `PayrollConfig`, `Companies`, `Notification`, `NotificationLogsModel`, `FixedSalaryLogModel`, `Recursive`, `Payslips`, `Payitems`, `EOSModel`, `SalaryAdjustment`, `OffCyclePayitems`, `CoreConfig`, `MonthlyWisePayitem`, and `PayrollModel`) to retrieve, process, and aggregate payroll data.

Key functionalities include: retrieving payroll processes (getAllPayrollProcess, getPayrollProcess, getPayrollProcessByCompanyIdKeysService, getPayrollProcessByFilterKeys, etc.),  filtering by company ID and status (getPayrollProcessActiveByCompanyIdService, getPayrollProcessActiveByConfigIdService, getPayrollProcessByCompanyIdStatStatus),  handling salary adjustments (payMonthSalaryAdjustment), retrieving user data using aggregation (getUserByAggregate, getUserIdByAggregateActive),  getting configuration data (getConfiguration), calculating payroll statistics (getCardsValue), computing variance between payroll periods (getPayrollProcessComputeVariance), and generating gratuity reports (getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity).

The code utilizes various libraries, including `mongoose`, `moment`, `lodash`, `crypto-js`, and an AWS SDK for SES email services.  The functions extensively use aggregate queries for efficient data retrieval and processing.  There's a significant reliance on `company_id` and `pay_month` for filtering and querying payroll data across multiple models, suggesting a structured approach to managing payroll information by company and pay period.  The `getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity` function demonstrates complex logic for gratuity calculations, including fetching and processing data from `PayrollConfig`, `User` and `CoreConfig` models.  The function also uses `moment.js` for date manipulation and includes checks for handling different cases based on the value of `selectedCompanyID`.

The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hitachi-gts-mcs-admin/plugins/general.js` file between 11:35:37 and 11:41:24 on April 17, 2025.  The code itself remained unchanged across all revisions.  The file contains a JavaScript module exporting various helper functions.  These functions handle tasks such as:

* **Date formatting:** Converting dates to different formats (`dateConvert`, `formatDate`).
* **User information retrieval:** Extracting full name, first name, last name, designation, payment mode, employee ID, and profile picture URL from a user object (`getUserFullName`, `getUserFirstName`, `getUserLastName`, `getPaymentMode`, `getUserDesignation`, `getImage`, `getEmployeeID`, `getUserName`, `getUserDetails`).  These functions frequently utilize `.filter` to find users based on `_id`.
* **Status and color mapping:** Assigning colors or text styles based on different status values (`getStatusColorTooltip`, `getLeaveStatus`, `getChipColor`, `getChipColorSalaryAdjustment`, `getAmountColor`, `getPayrollProcessStatus`, `getStatusColor`, `getPriorityColor`, `getPriorityFlagImage`, `getPriorityColorText`, `getStatusBorderColor`, `getTextColor`, `getPerformanceStatusColor`, `getTaskStatusColor`, `getUserStatusChipColor`).  The colors frequently used are teal, amber, red, and grey.
* **Leave information handling:** Determining leave status and retrieving images based on leave type (`getLeaveStatus`, `getLeaveImage`, `getLeaveColor`).
* **Other utility functions:**  Includes functions for lowercasing strings with space/ampersand replacement (`tolower`), updating pay item text (`payitemTextUpdate`), creating scales for charts (`createScale`), formatting performance metric values (`formatPerformanceMetricValue`), formatting numbers (`numberFormat`), and handling image URLs (`checkImage`).  There's also a `genericRule` for validation.

The repeated identical code suggests that no actual code changes were made; rather, the timestamps likely reflect actions like saving the file multiple times without content modification within the IDE or version control system.


## 12:46:56
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hitachi-gts-mcs-admin/plugins/general.js`  between 11:48:12 and 12:24:29 on April 17, 2025.  The  `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hitachi-gts-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` file was updated once at 11:49:34 on the same day.  There were no discernible changes in functionality within the `general.js` file across the multiple updates; the code remains consistent. This suggests repeated saves or minor, uncaptured edits rather than substantive code modifications.

The `salarySheetDT.vue` component's update introduced a Vue.js data table for displaying salary sheet data.  This component fetches data, formats it for display (using computed properties for coloring earnings and deductions based on value and dynamically generating headers from configuration data), and allows downloading the data as an XLSX sheet via a button.  A tooltip indicates salary adjustments for specific employees.  The table headers are dynamically generated based on the `config` prop, which determines which salary components (fixed, earnings, deductions, recurring earnings and deductions) are displayed. The table also includes a search functionality.


## 15:44:16
The log shows repeated modifications to a `.env` file between 14:53:32 and 15:01:06 on April 17, 2025.  The changes primarily involve a MongoDB aggregation pipeline within the `.env` file, designed to identify and remove duplicate records from a collection (initially referred to as  `your_collection_name`, later corrected to `payrolls`).  The pipeline groups documents by `pay_month`, `user_id`, `company_id`, `category`, and `amount`, then filters for groups with a count greater than 1 (duplicates).  The code iterates through these groups, keeping only the earliest record based on a `createdDate` field (if available), and deleting the rest.

The initial version of the aggregation pipeline at 14:53:32 incorrectly uses `your_collection_name` as the target collection for deletion.  This is corrected at 15:00:47 to `payrolls`.  Between 14:54:45 and 15:00:29, there are minor changes to the pipeline code, mostly concerning comments and formatting; the core logic remains the same. Finally, the `category` field is changed from a regular expression `(/mobile allowance/i)` to an exact string `"Mobile Allowance"` at 15:00:29 which represents a small functional change.  The overall pattern is iterative refinement of a database cleanup script embedded within the environment file.
