# Activity Summary for 09/04/2025

## 16:49:20
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 15:49 and 16:44 on 09/04/2025.

The `salarySheetDT.vue` component primarily focuses on rendering a salary sheet data table.  Changes involved refinements to how the table headers are generated dynamically based on the `config` prop (handling fixed, earning, and deduction fields),  and  minor adjustments to data formatting (`amountFormatterBHD`) and conditional styling (coloring earnings green and deductions red).  A significant change at 16:27:56 adds `console.log("ordered data",orderedData)` to the `computeSalarySheetDOJ` method, suggesting debugging efforts.  The initial changes (15:49) show the addition of an excel export button.  There were several updates in quick succession, mostly minor formatting and no significant functional changes after the first update.

The `pages/payroll/_id.vue` file displays payroll information and offers various actions.  Multiple revisions between 16:09 and 16:44 involved the addition and refinement of actions within the data table's action column. These actions include: generating supplementary payroll, approval requests, withholding employee salaries, submitting for approval, approving/rejecting payroll runs, and downloading bank files (SIF) for different currencies (AED, SAR, QAR). The `Download GL Report` function also appears to call a common `downloadXlSXSheet` function.  The numerous changes to this file are predominantly related to adding and adjusting UI elements and conditionals controlling action buttons.
