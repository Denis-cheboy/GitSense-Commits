# Activity Summary for 02/04/2025

## 12:09:52
The log shows multiple revisions to two Vue.js components (`approvalPayItems.vue`) and a page (`_id.vue`) within a payroll administration application.  The changes primarily focus on data display and user interaction within data tables.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/reuseable/approvalPayItems.vue` underwent several minor revisions between 11:28 and 11:46 on February 4th, 2025.  These modifications involved refining the display of employee IDs and names.  Initially, `emp_id` and `user_id` were rendered using a function call from `services_general`  to retrieve employee information from a `users` prop. Subsequent changes added a fallback mechanism to display `item.emp_id` and `item.full_name` directly if the lookup failed, improving robustness.  The core functionality of approving and rejecting pay items remained unchanged.  The `mounted()` lifecycle hook was updated to log both `approvalRequests` and `approvalRecRequests`.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` was modified between 11:34 and 11:39 on February 4th, 2025.  This file contains a data table for managing payroll processes. The updates consist of adding and refining features related to generating supplementary payroll cycles, handling approval requests (including a badge for pending requests and "Approve/Reject" dialogs), and offering various download options (SIF for UAE, KSA Bank File, QAR SIF, and a GL Report). There are many conditional statements managing the display of buttons based on the status and type of payroll run.  The core structure and data handling remained consistent across revisions.  The changes appear to be focused on enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements and options.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/plugins/general.js` was updated twice on February 4th, 2025, at 11:48. This plugin provides utility functions for the application.  The changes are not readily apparent from the provided diffs, however it contains various helper functions for date formatting, currency lookups, status handling, user information retrieval, and more.  The  size and complexity suggest a wide range of supporting tasks.

The provided log shows updates to two files within the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api` project.

The file `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/services/user.service.js` underwent multiple revisions on February 4th, 2025, between 12:35:51 and 12:42:54.  These revisions focused on adding and refining functions for bulk user operations.  Specifically, the changes include:

*   `createBulkUsers`: This function creates multiple users at once, handling cases where users or their managers already exist. It hashes passwords using `bcrypt.hash`.
*   `updateBulkUsers`: Updates existing users in bulk, also handling password hashing.
*   `bulkUpdateInsurance`:  Updates insurance information for users in bulk.
*   `uploadBulkDocuments`:  Uploads bulk documents, grouping them by employee ID and handling existing documents.  It adds timestamps and creator IDs to uploaded documents.
*   `updateBulkUserFields`: Updates multiple users with a specified key-value pair.
*   `updateManagers`: Updates the reporting manager for a list of employees.
*   `reassignReportingManager`: Reassigns users reporting to a specific manager to a new manager.


All these functions utilize `User.bulkWrite` for efficiency.  There's a consistent pattern of error handling with `try...catch` blocks and returning informative objects indicating success, the number of items processed, and errors encountered.


The file `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/services/document_templates.service.js` was updated twice on February 4th, 2025 at 13:09:08 and 13:09:21. These changes primarily concern document template management and payslip generation. The added functions include:

*   CRUD operations (`getAllDocumentTemplates`, `createDocumentTemplate`, `getDocumentTemplateById`, `updateDocumentTemplate`, `deleteDocumentTemplate`) for document templates, utilizing MongoDB's `ObjectId` for ID handling.
*   `getAllFields`: retrieves all fields from a specified module's model.
*   `getDocumentTemplateByConfigId`: retrieves a document template based on a configuration ID.
*   `getReplacedContentForPayslips`: and `getReplacedContentPDFForPayslips`: These functions are crucial for generating payslips. They fetch a document template, replace placeholders with data from the corresponding payslip using an external `axios` call to  `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContent` or `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContenttoPDF`, and return either the replaced content or upload the generated PDF to a storage service and return the URL. The `getReplacedDocumentData` function handles the complex data mapping and processing for payslip generation.  The code suggests a significant amount of data transformation and formatting happens before sending the request to the external PDF engine.


The `document_templates.service.js` file shows a clear separation of concerns, with functions dedicated to database interactions, data processing, and external API calls.  The `getReplacedContentPDFForPayslips` function specifically handles the upload of the generated PDF to a URL, updating the database record with this URL afterward.  Error handling is also present using consistent return objects.  The short time difference between the two commits suggests minor corrections or additions to the payslip generation logic.


## 13:09:54
The log shows several code changes across four files within the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin` project between 12:33 PM and 12:47 PM on February 4th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the approval and payroll functionalities.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/approval/index.vue` underwent multiple revisions within a short timeframe (12:33:17, 12:36:47, 12:36:52). These revisions involved adding a search functionality to filter approval requests (`searchText` variable and filtering logic).  A significant change was the introduction of `full_name` in the search filter for recursive requests. The core UI remained consistent, displaying approved/rejected requests via alerts and offering a toggle between "Recurring Items" and "Pay Items" for different approval request types.  Data fetching using `app.$axios` to retrieve payroll and recursive data consistently uses Authorization headers with a bearer token.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` was modified at 12:37:33, 12:39:46, and 12:47:32, 12:47:43. The updates primarily involved adding more functionalities to the payroll page, notably options to generate supplementary payroll, download bank files (SIF for UAE, KSA bank file, QAR SIF) and download GL reports in XLSX format.  The actions available to the user (Approve, Reject, Submit for Approval, Withhold Salary) depend on the payroll item's `status` and `submit_for_approval` flags. The UI uses Vue components like `v-data-table`, `v-btn`, `v-tooltip`, and `v-img` to display data and actions in a visually appealing manner. The consistent use of `app.$axios` with Authorization headers is noticeable.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/reuseable/approvalPayItems.vue` was updated at 12:41:42, 12:41:51 and 12:42:03.  This component handles the display of approval requests, separately for recursive and non-recursive items. It includes approve and reject functionalities for both types, sending requests to `/payroll/pay/items/approve`, `/payroll/pay/items/reject`, `/recursive/approve/`, and `/recursive/reject/` endpoints using `this.$axios` with bearer token based authorization headers.  The minor updates seem focused on code cleanup and consistency in formatting.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/plugins/general.js` saw one update at 12:42:19. This plugin contains several utility functions used across the application, including date formatting, currency retrieval based on country, and various helper functions for data manipulation and presentation.  These functions are used extensively within the other files, supporting features like date display, color-coding based on status or amount type, and user information retrieval.


The overall pattern shows a consistent use of Vue.js, axios for API calls, and moment.js for date handling. The codebase heavily relies on backend API interactions for data retrieval and manipulation, and features a clear separation of concerns between pages and reusable components.  The frequent updates within a short period suggest active development and iterative feature additions to the application.


## 17:01:22
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-api/api/payslips.js` file underwent several revisions on February 4th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be on the `/add` route within the API.

Initially, the code included various routes for retrieving payslip data (`GET /all`, `/distinct`, `/:_id`, `/pay-month/:_id`, `/pay-month/:_id/:company_id`, `/user/:_id`, `/user/:_id/:company_id`), updating payslips (`PUT /update/:_id`, `/update/emailstatus/:_id`), deleting payslips (`DELETE /delete/:_id`), adding new payslips (`POST /add`, `/new`), and sending emails (`POST /send-email`).  All routes except `/:_id` and `/user/crypto-val/:_id` use the `validateToken` middleware. The `user/crypto-val/:_id` uses `validateSecretKey`.  The email sending functionality utilizes AWS SES.

Between 16:24:54 and 16:33:32, the `/add` route was modified to handle and sanitize input data with a `variable` property containing dots (`.`). This was done by replacing the dots in keys with underscores (`_`) within the `cleanedVariable` object to prevent issues likely caused by the dots in the keys.  The changes made between 16:32:52 and 16:33:32 represent this specific improvement.  The code at 16:33:25 and 16:33:32 are identical.

Further refinements to the `/add` route occurred between 16:39:14 and 16:47:37. The regular expression used for key sanitization in the `cleanedVariable` object was slightly adjusted. This likely aimed to handle edge cases or improve the robustness of the key cleaning process. The key difference is the change from `/\./g` to `/\._/g` then `/\._/g, '_').replace(/\./g, '_`);`


Finally, at 16:55:42, the AWS SES configuration within the code was altered. The `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` were commented out.  This suggests a potential shift to a different authentication method or removal of direct key access for security reasons.  The `region` remains as "eu-central-1".
