# Activity Summary for 11/04/2025

## 10:08:16
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file underwent numerous revisions on October 4th, 2025, between 19:22 and 20:47, and again on November 4th, 2025 at 09:14, 09:16, 09:25, and 09:42.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the addition and modification of API routes related to user management and data retrieval.

A significant change occurred around 19:48 on October 4th, with the addition of `const {ObjectId}=require("mongoose")` and `const mongoose=require("mongoose")`.  This suggests an integration or update involving the Mongoose ODM for MongoDB.  There was another minor change at 20:06 on October 4th, correcting a syntax error in the line `const mongoose=`.


The file consistently uses  `UsersModel`, `AttendanceModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, and `NotificationLogsModel` suggesting a structured database schema involving users, their attendance, system configurations, and notification logs. The code uses MongoDB aggregation pipelines extensively for complex data retrieval, particularly in the `/client-dashboards` POST route, which retrieves aggregated data about attendance, claims, letters, leaves, and WFH requests for a given client and date.  The `/setup` POST route encrypts and stores user and configuration data in Redis using the `CryptoJS` library and a secret key from environment variables.  Multiple routes use a `validateSecretKey` function for security.  Several routes (`/all`, `/hide-profile/all`, `/active`, `/active-only`)  retrieve user data, with variations in filtering (e.g., active users only, hiding profiles). The code also interacts with AWS SES for email sending.  The `bycrpt` variable was renamed to `bcrypt` between October 4th and November 4th.

The frequent updates suggest iterative development and debugging. The consistent use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) indicates the code is designed for concurrent operations and handling of database interactions.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file underwent multiple revisions on November 4th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be the addition and refinement of API endpoints related to user management and data retrieval.

The initial versions (10:09:26, 10:14:58, 10:15:34, 10:18:35, 10:18:53, 10:19:07, 10:19:13, 10:19:59, 10:20:33, 10:20:41)  show a large, complex `router.post('/client-dashboards', ...)` function that uses MongoDB aggregation to fetch various data points based on a client ID and a given date.  This endpoint retrieves aggregated data concerning attendance, requests (claims, letters, etc.), leaves, and WFH (Work From Home) information.  There are no apparent changes to this function's core logic across these revisions.

Later revisions include no further changes to the `/client-dashboard` endpoint.

Subsequently, a `/setup` endpoint was added (visible from 10:09:26 onwards) which encrypts and stores user and configuration data in Redis using AES encryption with a secret key from environment variables.  This endpoint ensures data security by encrypting sensitive information before storage.

Additional endpoints were added or modified throughout the series of changes,  including  endpoints to retrieve all users (`/all`), active users (`/active`, `/active-only`), users with visible profiles (`/hide-profile/all`), and a specific user by ID (`/crypto-val/:_id`).  Many of these endpoints utilize the `validateToken` and `validateSecretKey` middleware functions for authentication and authorization.  There's also a commented-out endpoint suggesting earlier iterations involved a simple "Hello Employee" response.  The `/leaveupdate/all` endpoint appears to be identical to `/all`, suggesting it's either redundant or a work-in-progress. The  `/no-validation/all` endpoint is seemingly less secure, lacking token validation, but using secret key validation.  Finally, a `/global-dashboard/all` endpoint retrieves active users with specific fields and adds the total logged-in count for the current day.

The final revision at 10:30:06 shows no substantial changes compared to the previous ones.  The code remains consistent throughout the majority of changes, primarily adding and refining existing routes. The series of commits between 10:09:26 and 10:20:41 likely reflects iterative development and testing, with only minor modifications in each version. The final commit at 10:29:43 and 10:30:06 also shows no further significant changes to the core functionalities.
