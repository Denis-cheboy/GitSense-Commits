# Activity Summary for 24/04/2025

## 10:07:13
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file was updated on 24/04/2025 at 10:06:45.  The update significantly alters the payslip display component.  The changes include:

* **UI Enhancements:** The component's visual structure was redesigned using Vue.js components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, etc.) to display payslips and a password verification dialog.  It incorporates SVG images for visual cues (empty state, download icon).  Error handling and loading indicators (`v-progress-linear`) were added to improve user experience. Styling is applied using inline styles and scoped CSS.

* **Functionality Additions:**  A password verification modal (`dialog_password_check`) was implemented using bcrypt for password comparison before displaying payslips.  The component now fetches payslip data via API calls (`$axios.$get`) requiring authentication (`Authorization: AuthStr`). A download functionality (`startDownload`, `downloadPDF_payslip`) was added, handling cases where the payslip URL is directly available or needs to be fetched from the server.  A preview feature (`getPaylsipPreview`) allows users to see a payslip before download.  Empty state handling is present to display messages when no payslips are found.

* **Data Handling:** The component manages payslip data (`payslipData`, `payslips`), user information (`user`), and configuration data (`configData`).  Lodash (`_`) is used for array manipulation (ordering by pay month).  It uses Vuex getters (`$store.getters.getToken`, `$store.getters.getUser`) for accessing authentication token and user data.

* **Component Structure:** The component uses several sub-components: `PayslipListing`, `Payslip` (likely for individual payslip rendering) from  `~/components/reuseable` and `~/components/payslips` respectively.


The code uses asynchronous operations (async/await) for API calls, indicating a reliance on external data sources.  The use of `bcrypt` suggests security considerations are in place. The overall update seems to be a comprehensive overhaul of the payslip display, adding features, improving UI, and enhancing security.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` file underwent several revisions on April 24th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout these revisions: fetching payslip data from a Fayolle API (`https://fayolleapi.nathanhr.ae`), generating a PDF payslip using `jsPDF`, and uploading the generated PDF to an AWS S3 bucket.  The key changes were minor and focused on logging and error handling.


Specifically, between 10:10:15 and 10:20:08, a `console.log("up")` statement was added to the `getPayslipURL` function.  This suggests a debugging or monitoring addition.


Subsequently, between 10:20:08 and 10:20:21, the log statement was improved to `console.log("updatedPayslips",updatedPayslip)`, providing more context about the updated payslip information.  This showcases an iterative debugging process.

The code consistently uses `axios` for API calls to both the Fayolle API and potentially other internal services.  The PDF generation consistently uses a template that includes employee details, company logo (with conditional logic for different company IDs and logo sizes), fixed and variable compensations, and a footer.  The final PDF is uploaded to S3 with a filename based on the pay month and employee name.  The `getPayslipURL` function plays a central role by orchestrating these steps.  No substantial changes occurred to the underlying logic of other functions such as `getUserPayslipByIDService`, `getUserPayslipByMonthService`, or `getUserPayslipByMonthAndCompanyService` across the revisions.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` between 10:28 AM and 11:00 AM on April 24, 2025,  and  `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/nuxt.config.js` between 10:39 AM and 11:02 AM on the same day.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file underwent significant changes related to its UI and functionality.  Initial commits focused on the structure and presentation of payslip information, then later commits introduced internationalization using the `$t()` function to translate various UI elements. A loading overlay was added to improve the user experience during payslip generation.  The final version includes a  `PreviewDocument` component for displaying the payslip. The changes suggest an iterative process of improving the UI and adding features to the payslip component.

The  `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/nuxt.config.js` file received updates adding several new environment variables (`configURL`, `productId`, `supportToken`) to the `env` object, indicating potential integration with additional services or configuration options.  Additionally, several new plugins were added to the Nuxt.js configuration, suggesting expansion of project capabilities with new libraries such as `@nuxtjs/date-fns` and `~/plugins/dynamic-locales.js`, which enhances the date handling and internationalization support.  The primary color in the Vuetify theme was also changed from  `#24576a` to `#4263EB`.  The addition of `config.performance` to the build section hints at optimization efforts concerning asset sizes.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file was updated on 24/04/2025 at 11:09:31.  The update significantly revised the component's UI and functionality related to displaying and downloading payslips.

The Vue component now features two main sections: a list of payslips and a payslip preview area.  The payslip list uses `PayslipListing` components to render individual payslips, showing an empty state if no payslips are found.  A download button, implemented using `v-btn` and `mdi-download-outline` icon, triggers the `startDownload` method. This method initiates a download process, showing a loading overlay (`overlay_dialog`) during the download. The download itself uses an API call (`/payslips/url/get/new/`) to fetch a URL for the payslip PDF and opens it in a new window.  Error handling is included within the `downloadPDF_payslip` method.

A password verification dialog (`dialog_password_check`) is implemented using bcrypt for password comparison, ensuring secure access to payslip information. The component interacts with a backend API to fetch payslip data based on user and configuration IDs.  Data manipulation using Lodash's `orderBy` function is used to sort payslips by pay month in descending order. The component also makes use of Vuex's getters (`this.$store.getters.getToken`, `this.$store.getters.getUser`) for retrieving user authentication token and user information.  The `getServiceRequestOnLoad` method handles the case when no payslips are available.

Styling using scoped CSS is applied to hide details in text fields.  The component utilizes several Vuetify components such as `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-img`, `v-tooltip` etc. for its structure and user interface elements.


## 14:07:12
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/server.js` file between 13:57:17 and 13:58:44 on 24/04/2025.  The core functionality of the server remains consistent across all revisions, acting as an API endpoint with numerous routes for various features (Redis data handling, location, companies, roles, users, processes, ticketing, logging, settings, notifications, configuration, stories, to-do lists, leave credits, payslips, payroll, recursive functions, chats, history, and events).

The changes primarily revolve around the `/api/socials` route. Initially, there's a typo, with `recuriveRouter` used incorrectly.  This is corrected in subsequent commits, with the correct `socialsRouter` being correctly imported and used at  13:58:44.  The other observed changes are minor and likely due to auto-formatting or minor edits not affecting core functionality.  A cron job is scheduled to run `leaveCreditsHelper.updateUserLeaveCredits()` daily at 01:00.  The file consistently uses various libraries including `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, `body-parser`, `sendgrid`, `express-fileupload`, `connect-timeout`, and `node-cron`.
