# Activity Summary for 24/04/2025

## 10:07:13
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file was updated on 24/04/2025 at 10:06:45.  The update significantly alters the payslip display component.  The changes include:

* **UI Enhancements:** The component's visual structure was redesigned using Vue.js components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, etc.) to display payslips and a password verification dialog.  It incorporates SVG images for visual cues (empty state, download icon).  Error handling and loading indicators (`v-progress-linear`) were added to improve user experience. Styling is applied using inline styles and scoped CSS.

* **Functionality Additions:**  A password verification modal (`dialog_password_check`) was implemented using bcrypt for password comparison before displaying payslips.  The component now fetches payslip data via API calls (`$axios.$get`) requiring authentication (`Authorization: AuthStr`). A download functionality (`startDownload`, `downloadPDF_payslip`) was added, handling cases where the payslip URL is directly available or needs to be fetched from the server.  A preview feature (`getPaylsipPreview`) allows users to see a payslip before download.  Empty state handling is present to display messages when no payslips are found.

* **Data Handling:** The component manages payslip data (`payslipData`, `payslips`), user information (`user`), and configuration data (`configData`).  Lodash (`_`) is used for array manipulation (ordering by pay month).  It uses Vuex getters (`$store.getters.getToken`, `$store.getters.getUser`) for accessing authentication token and user data.

* **Component Structure:** The component uses several sub-components: `PayslipListing`, `Payslip` (likely for individual payslip rendering) from  `~/components/reuseable` and `~/components/payslips` respectively.


The code uses asynchronous operations (async/await) for API calls, indicating a reliance on external data sources.  The use of `bcrypt` suggests security considerations are in place. The overall update seems to be a comprehensive overhaul of the payslip display, adding features, improving UI, and enhancing security.
