# Activity Summary for 24/04/2025

## 10:07:13
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file was updated on 24/04/2025 at 10:06:45.  The update significantly alters the payslip display component.  The changes include:

* **UI Enhancements:** The component's visual structure was redesigned using Vue.js components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, etc.) to display payslips and a password verification dialog.  It incorporates SVG images for visual cues (empty state, download icon).  Error handling and loading indicators (`v-progress-linear`) were added to improve user experience. Styling is applied using inline styles and scoped CSS.

* **Functionality Additions:**  A password verification modal (`dialog_password_check`) was implemented using bcrypt for password comparison before displaying payslips.  The component now fetches payslip data via API calls (`$axios.$get`) requiring authentication (`Authorization: AuthStr`). A download functionality (`startDownload`, `downloadPDF_payslip`) was added, handling cases where the payslip URL is directly available or needs to be fetched from the server.  A preview feature (`getPaylsipPreview`) allows users to see a payslip before download.  Empty state handling is present to display messages when no payslips are found.

* **Data Handling:** The component manages payslip data (`payslipData`, `payslips`), user information (`user`), and configuration data (`configData`).  Lodash (`_`) is used for array manipulation (ordering by pay month).  It uses Vuex getters (`$store.getters.getToken`, `$store.getters.getUser`) for accessing authentication token and user data.

* **Component Structure:** The component uses several sub-components: `PayslipListing`, `Payslip` (likely for individual payslip rendering) from  `~/components/reuseable` and `~/components/payslips` respectively.


The code uses asynchronous operations (async/await) for API calls, indicating a reliance on external data sources.  The use of `bcrypt` suggests security considerations are in place. The overall update seems to be a comprehensive overhaul of the payslip display, adding features, improving UI, and enhancing security.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` file underwent several revisions on April 24th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout these revisions: fetching payslip data from a Fayolle API (`https://fayolleapi.nathanhr.ae`), generating a PDF payslip using `jsPDF`, and uploading the generated PDF to an AWS S3 bucket.  The key changes were minor and focused on logging and error handling.


Specifically, between 10:10:15 and 10:20:08, a `console.log("up")` statement was added to the `getPayslipURL` function.  This suggests a debugging or monitoring addition.


Subsequently, between 10:20:08 and 10:20:21, the log statement was improved to `console.log("updatedPayslips",updatedPayslip)`, providing more context about the updated payslip information.  This showcases an iterative debugging process.

The code consistently uses `axios` for API calls to both the Fayolle API and potentially other internal services.  The PDF generation consistently uses a template that includes employee details, company logo (with conditional logic for different company IDs and logo sizes), fixed and variable compensations, and a footer.  The final PDF is uploaded to S3 with a filename based on the pay month and employee name.  The `getPayslipURL` function plays a central role by orchestrating these steps.  No substantial changes occurred to the underlying logic of other functions such as `getUserPayslipByIDService`, `getUserPayslipByMonthService`, or `getUserPayslipByMonthAndCompanyService` across the revisions.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` between 10:28 AM and 11:00 AM on April 24, 2025,  and  `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/nuxt.config.js` between 10:39 AM and 11:02 AM on the same day.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/payslip.vue` file underwent significant changes related to its UI and functionality.  Initial commits focused on the structure and presentation of payslip information, then later commits introduced internationalization using the `$t()` function to translate various UI elements. A loading overlay was added to improve the user experience during payslip generation.  The final version includes a  `PreviewDocument` component for displaying the payslip. The changes suggest an iterative process of improving the UI and adding features to the payslip component.

The  `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-admin/nuxt.config.js` file received updates adding several new environment variables (`configURL`, `productId`, `supportToken`) to the `env` object, indicating potential integration with additional services or configuration options.  Additionally, several new plugins were added to the Nuxt.js configuration, suggesting expansion of project capabilities with new libraries such as `@nuxtjs/date-fns` and `~/plugins/dynamic-locales.js`, which enhances the date handling and internationalization support.  The primary color in the Vuetify theme was also changed from  `#24576a` to `#4263EB`.  The addition of `config.performance` to the build section hints at optimization efforts concerning asset sizes.
