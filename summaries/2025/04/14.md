# Activity Summary for 14/04/2025

## 12:14:47
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-api/models/users.js` file, last updated on 14/04/2025 at 11:14:48, defines a Mongoose schema for users.  The schema includes a wide range of fields covering personal information (name, email, contact details), employment details (contract type, employment type, date of joining, salary),  access control (roles, tokens), security (password hashing, login attempts), and various other attributes like company ID, attachments, and  leaves.

Significant features include:

* **Password Hashing:**  The schema uses `bcrypt` to hash passwords before saving and on updates.
* **JWT Authentication:** It utilizes `jsonwebtoken` for generating access and refresh tokens (`generateAuthToken`, `generateAuthTokens`).  Token expiration is managed using `moment.js`.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** The schema includes numerous methods (`checkIsAdmin`, `checkIsSuperAdmin`, `checkIsClientAdmin`, etc.) to check a user's role (`role_ID`) and grant access accordingly.  Specific `role_ID` values define different roles (e.g., Admin, Super Admin, HR, Employee).
* **Session Management:** The `startSession` method uses `uuidv4` to create and save user sessions.
* **Login Security:**  The `findByCredentials` static method verifies user credentials and includes checks for inactive users and restricted access based on roles.  It also handles unsuccessful login attempts.
* **Extensive Data Storage:** The schema demonstrates a comprehensive design, storing a wide variety of user-related data in various formats (String, Number, Object, Array, Map).

The code uses several external libraries: `mongoose`, `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `moment`, and `uuid`.  The repeated pattern of `checkIs[Role]` methods suggests a potential area for refactoring into a more generic role-checking mechanism.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-admin/pages/users/index.vue` on April 14, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor adjustments and refinements within the Vue.js component, focusing on the UI and likely not affecting core functionality.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense activity between 12:05 PM and 12:29 PM, with numerous edits within a short timeframe.  The code consistently presents an employee list interface with features like:

* **Add New User:** A button to add new employees (controlled by the `employee_drawer` data property).
* **Search Functionality:** A search bar (`v-model="search"` and `@input="searchEmp"`) for filtering employees.
* **Excel Export:** An "Export" button that utilizes a `download-excel` component to export employee data (`getUserDetails` data property and `json_fields_employees` prop).
* **Bulk Email:** A button to send a bulk email for payslip passwords (linked to `sendPayslipPasswordEmailAllEmployeesDialog`).
* **Advanced Search Filter:**  An expandable filter section offering granular control over filtering employees by ID, status, name, email, designation, company, department, cost center, date of joining (DOJ), and last working date (LWD).  Date filters allow for selecting ranges ("Between", etc).
* **Employee Display:**  The employee list itself uses a `v-list` to display employee details including name, ID, designation, email, department, and team.  Visual cues are applied based on employee status (`getUserStatusColor`).
* **Profile Picture Upload:** In a separate section, there's a profile picture upload mechanism using a `v-file-input` component (using the `onProfilePictureFile` method).

No significant structural changes were observed in the component across the many revisions; instead, the modifications seem primarily cosmetic or aimed at improving the user interface and filtering options.


## 13:22:12
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file between 12:22:55 and 12:40:11 on April 14, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same file without structural alterations to the code. There were no significant content changes across the revisions.  The file consistently uses `express.js` for routing,  `mongoose` for database interaction, `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `crypto-js` for encryption, and `ioredis` for Redis caching.  The code predominantly involves API endpoints for retrieving and manipulating user data, including functionalities like setting up data in Redis and retrieving dashboards based on client ID and date. The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/models/users.js` file was also updated at 12:24:57, likely to accommodate the changes made in the API routes.  This file defines a Mongoose schema for user data, including methods for generating auth tokens, checking user roles, and handling password hashing.


## 13:42:29
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-admin/pages/users/index.vue`  between 12:46:03 and 13:37:42 on April 14, 2025.  The changes are minor and iterative, primarily focused on the UI  of an employee list component built using Vue.js and a Vuetify component library.

The file consistently displays an employee list with features such as:

* **Add New User Button:** A button to add new employees (linked to `employee_drawer`).
* **Employee Cards:** Cards displaying employee counts and names.
* **Search Functionality:** A search bar (`v-text-field` with `@input="searchEmp"`) for filtering employees.
* **Export to Excel:** An "Export" button using a `download-excel` component to export employee data.
* **Bulk Email Functionality:** A button to send bulk emails (`sendPayslipPasswordEmailAllEmployeesDialog`).
* **Advanced Search Filters:**  An expandable advanced search section with filters for employee ID, status, name, email, designation, company, department, cost center, date of joining (DOJ), and last working date (LWD). These filters use `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, and `v-date-picker` components.
* **Employee Display:** A list (`v-list`) displaying employee details including name, ID, designation, email, and department/team information.  The status of the employee affects the display color.
* **Profile Picture Upload:**  In the right-hand panel, an area for updating employee profile pictures using a `v-file-input` component.

The revisions between 12:46:03 and 12:46:52 seem to involve very minor adjustments, possibly whitespace or formatting changes,  as the core functionality and structure remain unchanged. The final revision at 13:37:42 appears to be a very minor change, possibly replacing  `<v-icon>mdi-email</v-icon>` with `<v-icon>mdi-email-outline</v-icon>` in the email display section of the employee list.  The overall changes between the first and last timestamps are negligible. The core structure and features of the employee list component remain consistent throughout all revisions.


## 13:43:51
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-admin/pages/user/download-payslips/_id.vue` file, updated on 14/04/2025, 13:26:45, is a Vue.js component for displaying payslips.  The component features a password verification dialog, initially set to `true`.  After successful password verification (using an API call to `/users/payslip-validation/`), it displays the user's payslips using pagination (9 per page).  Payslips are fetched via `/users/info/payslip/` using a decrypted ID from the route parameters. The component also includes a password reset functionality triggered by `/users/payslip-forgot-password`.  The password reset functionality sends a reset link to the user's email and adds a unique token to the database via the `/users/add-unique-token` endpoint. The UI provides visual feedback for password strength requirements, and utilizes `bcryptjs` and `crypto-js` for password hashing and encryption/decryption respectively.  Error handling is included to manage password mismatches and API failures.  A significant portion of the code deals with user authentication and password management.  The component uses several Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-pagination`, `v-dialog`, etc.) for layout and styling.  The `PayslipTemplate` and `Payslip` components are imported for rendering payslip data.
