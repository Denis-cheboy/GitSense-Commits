# Activity Summary for 08/04/2025

## 11:16:29
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/payslips.js` file between 10:24:30 and 10:30:45 on 08/04/2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and additions, not substantial code changes.  The file defines API routes for managing payslips, using `PayslipsModel` for database interaction.  Many routes utilize `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  A recurring element is the handling of potential errors by returning a JSON object with an `err.message` property.  There's also a commented-out section of code suggesting a previous implementation for bulk payslip creation, which involved data transformation and currency formatting.  The `validateSecretKey` function is used for validating encrypted data received in certain requests. The commented-out code section includes functions `funGetCompanyCurrency` and `funGetCompanyCurrencyDenominations` to convert currency codes to their full names and denominations, respectively.  No significant structural changes are observed in the code across these revisions.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/users.js` file shows one entry at 10:16:26 on 08/04/2025. This file defines API routes for user management.  It uses `UsersModel` for database operations and includes authentication (`validateToken`) and encryption (`CryptoJS`) functionalities.  The code includes various routes to fetch users based on different criteria (status, role, department, etc.) and a route to update user payslip passwords. The use of Redis for caching user and configuration data is also evident.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file underwent numerous revisions between 13:38:01 and 13:54:03 on August 4, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: handling various requests related to user data, including retrieving users, setting up data in Redis, and providing dashboards.  Notably, several routes consistently used  `validateSecretKey(req.body.enc)` for validation before processing requests.

The most significant change was the addition of the `bycrpt` library at 13:43:39, suggesting an update related to password hashing or encryption.  Before this timestamp, the code lacked explicit password handling, and only encryption of user data for storage in Redis was apparent.

There's a recurring pattern of fetching and returning user data (`UsersModel.find()`) from different routes, often with varying filtering conditions (e.g., `/active`, `/hide-profile/all`, `/active-only`). The `/client-dashboards` endpoint shows a complex aggregation pipeline using the `UsersModel` along with other models ("requests", "leaves", "wfh", "attendances") to fetch dashboard data, this was present across all revisions. The `/setup` endpoint encrypts user and configuration data using `CryptoJS.AES` and stores them in Redis.  This encryption uses the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable, which is not directly shown in the logs.  Several routes are commented out, indicating potential older, unused functionalities.  The timestamps show a period of frequent modifications clustered around 13:38 and another around 13:44-13:48, indicating potential phases of development or debugging.

On August 4th, 2025, at 14:21:02, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-api/models/users.js` file was updated.  This update significantly modified the `usersSchema`, which defines the structure for user data in a Mongoose schema.  The changes include adding numerous fields to the schema, covering a wide range of user attributes: personal information, employment details, bank information, education, work experience, documents, reporting structure, onboarding status, leave information, salary details, social media links, competencies, company and role IDs, user status, images, security settings, and login attempts.

The schema also incorporates pre-save middleware to hash passwords using bcryptjs before saving new users and updating existing ones, ensuring password security.  Several methods were added to the schema, primarily for generating various types of authentication tokens (access and refresh tokens) using JWT, managing user sessions with UUIDs, and implementing numerous helper methods to check user roles (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isClientAdmin`, `isHR`, `isManager`, `isOnboarding`, `isEmployee`, `isFinanceMgr`, `isHRMgr`, `isSalAcc`),  check probation status, and verify first login status.  A static method `findByCredentials` was also added for user authentication, including checks for user status and role-based access control.  The extensive use of `moment.js` indicates time-related functionalities in token generation and expiration.  The reliance on `bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken` highlights the security-focused nature of the update.
