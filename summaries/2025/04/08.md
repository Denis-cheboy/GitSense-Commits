# Activity Summary for 08/04/2025

## 11:16:29
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/payslips.js` file between 10:24:30 and 10:30:45 on 08/04/2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and additions, not substantial code changes.  The file defines API routes for managing payslips, using `PayslipsModel` for database interaction.  Many routes utilize `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  A recurring element is the handling of potential errors by returning a JSON object with an `err.message` property.  There's also a commented-out section of code suggesting a previous implementation for bulk payslip creation, which involved data transformation and currency formatting.  The `validateSecretKey` function is used for validating encrypted data received in certain requests. The commented-out code section includes functions `funGetCompanyCurrency` and `funGetCompanyCurrencyDenominations` to convert currency codes to their full names and denominations, respectively.  No significant structural changes are observed in the code across these revisions.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/users.js` file shows one entry at 10:16:26 on 08/04/2025. This file defines API routes for user management.  It uses `UsersModel` for database operations and includes authentication (`validateToken`) and encryption (`CryptoJS`) functionalities.  The code includes various routes to fetch users based on different criteria (status, role, department, etc.) and a route to update user payslip passwords. The use of Redis for caching user and configuration data is also evident.
