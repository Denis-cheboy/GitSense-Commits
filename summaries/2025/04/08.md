# Activity Summary for 08/04/2025

## 11:16:29
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/payslips.js` file between 10:24:30 and 10:30:45 on 08/04/2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and additions, not substantial code changes.  The file defines API routes for managing payslips, using `PayslipsModel` for database interaction.  Many routes utilize `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  A recurring element is the handling of potential errors by returning a JSON object with an `err.message` property.  There's also a commented-out section of code suggesting a previous implementation for bulk payslip creation, which involved data transformation and currency formatting.  The `validateSecretKey` function is used for validating encrypted data received in certain requests. The commented-out code section includes functions `funGetCompanyCurrency` and `funGetCompanyCurrencyDenominations` to convert currency codes to their full names and denominations, respectively.  No significant structural changes are observed in the code across these revisions.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/users.js` file shows one entry at 10:16:26 on 08/04/2025. This file defines API routes for user management.  It uses `UsersModel` for database operations and includes authentication (`validateToken`) and encryption (`CryptoJS`) functionalities.  The code includes various routes to fetch users based on different criteria (status, role, department, etc.) and a route to update user payslip passwords. The use of Redis for caching user and configuration data is also evident.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file underwent numerous revisions between 13:38:01 and 13:54:03 on August 4, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: handling various requests related to user data, including retrieving users, setting up data in Redis, and providing dashboards.  Notably, several routes consistently used  `validateSecretKey(req.body.enc)` for validation before processing requests.

The most significant change was the addition of the `bycrpt` library at 13:43:39, suggesting an update related to password hashing or encryption.  Before this timestamp, the code lacked explicit password handling, and only encryption of user data for storage in Redis was apparent.

There's a recurring pattern of fetching and returning user data (`UsersModel.find()`) from different routes, often with varying filtering conditions (e.g., `/active`, `/hide-profile/all`, `/active-only`). The `/client-dashboards` endpoint shows a complex aggregation pipeline using the `UsersModel` along with other models ("requests", "leaves", "wfh", "attendances") to fetch dashboard data, this was present across all revisions. The `/setup` endpoint encrypts user and configuration data using `CryptoJS.AES` and stores them in Redis.  This encryption uses the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable, which is not directly shown in the logs.  Several routes are commented out, indicating potential older, unused functionalities.  The timestamps show a period of frequent modifications clustered around 13:38 and another around 13:44-13:48, indicating potential phases of development or debugging.
