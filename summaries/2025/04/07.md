# Activity Summary for 07/04/2025

## 10:05:36
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 09:17:24 and 10:05:13 on July 4th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor adjustments and likely reflect iterative refinements to the code rather than substantial functional alterations.  All revisions maintain the core structure of the component, which displays a payroll process summary using a `v-data-table`.  This table shows payroll sheet details including creation date, type (Monthly/Supplementary), status, and actions.  The actions include adding new pay items (`AddNewPayitem`, `AddNewPayitemOffCycle`), handling approval requests (`handleSubmitForApproval`, `handleApproveRejectDialog`), withholding salary (`dialog_withheld_salary`), and downloading various reports (`handleDownloadSIF`, `downloadKSABankFile`, `downloadQARBankFile`, `services_general.downloadXlSXSheet`).  The repetitive nature of the code suggests a possible copy-paste approach with minor modifications for different bank file downloads (UAE, KSA, Qatar). No significant changes in functionality are evident between revisions.


## 11:05:36
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 10:06 AM and 10:54 AM on July 4th, 2025.  These edits appear to be minor adjustments and do not significantly alter the core functionality. The code within this file primarily focuses on displaying and interacting with payroll data, using Vue.js components and a v-data-table for presentation.  There are numerous v-if and v-else-if statements controlling the visibility of buttons based on the status ('active', 'inactive') and type ('Monthly', 'Supplementary') of payroll items.  Actions include generating supplementary payrolls, handling approval requests, withholding salaries, and downloading various bank files (SIF for UAE, KSA, and QAR).

A separate file, `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`, was also modified between 10:32 AM and 10:34 AM on the same day. This component is responsible for displaying a salary sheet data table.  The changes involved adding or refining the functionality to display salary adjustments and using conditional styling to highlight earnings and deductions.  The `getHeaders` computed property dynamically generates the table headers based on the provided configuration (`config.fixed`, `config.earning`, `config.deduction`) and data.  There is also a search functionality added.  The component includes a download button for exporting data to an Excel sheet.
