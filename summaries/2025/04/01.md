The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 10:20:46 AM and 10:23:55 AM on January 4th, 2025.  The primary change involves the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Initially commented out or empty, it's updated at 10:23:49 AM to point to a MongoDB database: `mongodb+srv://wilhelmsen-mcs-prod:ekaRXV1tzDfSXwJV@prod-a.4q4jk.mongodb.net/wilhelmsen-mcs-prod`. This value remains consistent in the subsequent update at 10:23:55 AM.  Other variables, such as those related to AWS, SendGrid, JWT configuration, and various database connections, remain unchanged throughout the log.  The file consistently contains numerous commented-out lines suggesting multiple previous database configurations.  There's no discernible pattern in the commented-out lines except that they also represent MongoDB connections.
