# Activity Summary for 01/04/2025

## 11:03:45
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` on January 4th, 2025.  The changes are incremental, with minor modifications made between 10:53:13 and 11:01:37.  The code is primarily Vue.js, utilizing components like `<v-card>`, `<v-img>`, `<v-btn>`, `<v-text-field>`, and `<v-chip>`, suggesting the use of a Vuetify framework.


The file consistently displays employee data, including options to add new users, search, and filter data (by ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, date of joining, and last working date).  A download functionality is included, allowing exports of employee details in an Excel format using the `download-excel` component.  The displayed employee count is dynamically updated, possibly based on filtering.  There's also a section displaying male and female employee percentages, using placeholders for images.

The changes between timestamps don't reflect major structural alterations.  Instead, the edits appear focused on refining the UI elements and data display,  possibly addressing minor bugs or improving user experience.  No significant changes or patterns in functionality are apparent from the provided snippets.


## 11:04:01
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 10:20:46 AM and 10:23:55 AM on January 4th, 2025.  The primary change involves the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Initially commented out or empty, it's updated at 10:23:49 AM to point to a MongoDB database: `mongodb+srv://wilhelmsen-mcs-prod:ekaRXV1tzDfSXwJV@prod-a.4q4jk.mongodb.net/wilhelmsen-mcs-prod`. This value remains consistent in the subsequent update at 10:23:55 AM.  Other variables, such as those related to AWS, SendGrid, JWT configuration, and various database connections, remain unchanged throughout the log.  The file consistently contains numerous commented-out lines suggesting multiple previous database configurations.  There's no discernible pattern in the commented-out lines except that they also represent MongoDB connections.


## 12:03:48
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` on January 4th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the UI elements within a Vue.js component, likely responsible for displaying and managing employee information.

The initial timestamps (11:05:06 - 11:16:38) show a series of minor edits, possibly refining the layout and styling.  The code consistently uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`)  for building the user interface.  There's evidence of features such as an "Add New User" functionality (`addUserFlag`), search functionality (`search`), and gender-based employee counts (`maleCount`, `femaleCount`).  A download feature using the `download-excel` component is also present, allowing for export of employee data.  There are also commented-out sections of code which suggest parts of the UI are being refactored or are temporary.

A significant change occurs around 11:19:20, suggesting a potential structural reorganization of UI elements, although the specific differences from the previous versions are not entirely clear without a diff tool.  Another minor update occurs at 11:22:24 and 11:22:41, followed by another around 11:26:43 and 11:27:08.  These minor edits appear to be further UI refinements and may involve bug fixes or minor styling adjustments. A final update appears at 11:52:52 which shows no apparent change from the previous commit.  The consistent nature of the edits suggests ongoing development and refinement of this employee management component.


## 13:04:01
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 12:22:05 PM and 12:57:20 PM on January 4th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve commenting and uncommenting lines related to `DATABASE_URL`, suggesting a switching between different database configurations (possibly for different environments like development, testing, or production).  No clear pattern emerges other than this selection process for the `DATABASE_URL`.  The rest of the environment variables remain largely consistent throughout the log entries.  There are numerous MongoDB connection strings present, various AWS credentials (commented out in some entries), SendGrid API keys,  JWT settings (JWT_SECRET, JWT_KEY, etc.), and other settings for different services like Mailtrap, SFTP and Microsoft single sign-on.  The  `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` shows some changes over the timeframe. The  `Micro_Service_API_KEY` is a long, seemingly encoded string.  Overall, the file appears to manage numerous environment-specific configurations for an application using various services.


## 16:24:10
The log shows three consecutive updates to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file between 15:24:18 and 15:24:39 on January 4th, 2025.  The changes are all minor and affect only the `dev` and `devMac` scripts within the `scripts` section of the `package.json`.

Initially, the `dev` script used `cross-env NODE_ENV=dev`, which was then corrected to `cross-env NODE_ENV=development` in the second update.  The third update made the same `NODE_ENV=development` change to the `devMac` script, ensuring consistency in environment variable settings across development scripts for different operating systems.  The rest of the `package.json` file, including its dependencies and other scripts, remained unchanged throughout these three commits.  The updates suggest a focus on improving the accuracy and consistency of the development environment setup.
