# Activity Summary for 28/04/2025

## 12:46:40
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` component, updated on 28/04/2025 at 11:54:29, allows bulk uploading of salary adjustments via a CSV file.  The component features:

* **A modal dialog:**  This dialog guides the user through the upload process, allowing them to upload a CSV, preview the data, and add/remove entries before final submission.  Error handling is included for missing or incorrectly formatted employee IDs.

* **CSV Preview:**  A `v-data-table` displays the parsed CSV data, enabling users to review and edit entries before upload.  Each row shows employee information fetched from the backend and an "Add Item" or "Delete Item" button, depending on the data's validity and current status.

* **Data Validation & Error Handling:** The component validates user input and provides clear error messages in the UI.  It checks for required fields, correct data types, and the presence of employee IDs. It handles cases where employee IDs are missing and displays the error information in the preview.

* **Excel Generation:** A `generateExcel` function creates and downloads an Excel template file for users to populate before uploading.

* **Backend Interaction:** The component makes API calls to fetch user data (`getUsersData`), configuration data (`getConfig`), and ultimately upload the processed salary adjustment data (although this final API call is commented out in the provided code snippet).  The API endpoints used are `/users/payroll/req-fields/` and `/payrollConfig/get/config/`.  Authentication is handled using a Bearer token retrieved from the Vuex store.

* **Loading Indicators:** `isLoading` and `dialog_overlay` display progress indicators during API calls.

* **Papa Parse & ExcelJS:** Uses the `papaparse` library for CSV parsing and `exceljs` for Excel file generation.


The code uses Vue.js components,  `v-dialog`, `v-data-table`, `v-file-input`, and other Vuetify components. The `mounted` lifecycle hook fetches necessary data from the backend.  The `methods` section contains functions for handling CSV upload, preview, data manipulation, and backend interaction.  The `headers_Adjustment` array dynamically builds the columns of the data table based on configuration data fetched from the server.  The key functionality involves parsing the CSV, validating data against existing employee records, and presenting the information in a user-friendly way before the final upload (which is currently not fully implemented based on the provided code).

The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file between 11:58 AM and 12:44 PM on April 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `/add-item-many`  endpoint which handles bulk salary adjustment requests.

Initially, this endpoint was incomplete or a placeholder.  Subsequent commits fleshed out the functionality. Key improvements include:

* **Data Retrieval for Approval Workflow:** The code was modified to fetch salary adjustment approver configuration using `configurationModel.aggregate([{ $project: {"salaryAdjustmentApprover": 1 }}])`. This retrieves the necessary data to define the approval workflow for salary adjustments.

* **Approval Array Construction:**  The code constructs an `approvalsArray` based on the retrieved configuration.  This array structures the approval process, assigning approvers and their initial statuses ("Processing" or "Pending").

* **Application Log Updates:** An `applicationLog` array is added to track the request's lifecycle, including who created it and its current status.

* **Prorating Calculation:** The existing calculation of prorated amounts for salary adjustments remains consistent across all commits.

* **Notification System Integration:** After saving the salary adjustment request, the code iterates through the first level approvers, sending each a notification using the `sendNotification` function.  This suggests integration with a notification service.

* **Minor Fixes:**  There were several commits addressing minor syntax errors and typos in the code, indicating iterative development and refinement.  The most significant of these changes involved replacing `appliction_log` with `logs` in the `creationBody` object.

The overall pattern suggests the development of a robust API endpoint for handling and managing multiple salary adjustment requests, encompassing an approval workflow and notification system. The use of `moment-timezone` indicates a need for handling timezones in the application.  The consistent use of `validateToken` middleware suggests a focus on API security.


## 13:47:00
The log shows multiple updates to two Vue components: `salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` and `employment.vue`.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes on April 28th, 2025.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` underwent several revisions.  No functional changes are apparent in the multiple revisions between 12:53:14 and 13:00:58. A significant change occurred at 13:43:12, adding an API call to `/configuration/payrollConfig/get-req-conf` within the `getConfig` method. This suggests fetching additional configuration data related to payroll.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` was updated between 13:11:46 and 13:31:32. The most notable change during this period involves the addition of a button triggering a  "Bulk Salary Adjustment" modal, likely using the  `salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` component.  This suggests an integration between the two components, allowing for bulk salary adjustments directly from the employee management view.  There are also minor UI refinements, such as the presentation of the number of male and female employees.  The  commented-out code suggests the removal of a section previously displaying employee counts with cards.  The addition of a download button for the user details implies improved data export capabilities.
