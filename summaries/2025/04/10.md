# Activity Summary for 10/04/2025

## 10:27:48
The log shows several code modifications across two Vue.js components: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/payslips/view/_id.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`, and one Vue.js page: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue`.  The changes span a period from 09:27:42 to 10:23:55 on October 4th, 2025.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/payslips/view/_id.vue`: This file, updated at 09:27:42,  is a Vue component for viewing payslips. The code displays employee details (name, ID, phone, email, etc.) and provides a tabbed interface for selecting payslips by year.  It uses Vuetify components extensively for layout and styling, and fetches data using `asyncData` for user information and payslip data via API calls. The component also includes custom methods for data formatting and manipulation.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`: This component, updated multiple times between 09:49:58 and 10:23:55,  manages the display and filtering of employees.  Significant changes involved adding a section for displaying the number of male and female employees along with their percentages, and implementing an advanced search functionality using Vuetify's `v-text-field`, `v-select`, and `v-chip` components. The component allows exporting employee information and documents to excel using the `download-excel` component. The functionality to add new users is also present.  The multiple updates to this file suggest iterative development and refinement of the filtering and display features.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue`: This login page underwent several revisions between 10:08:34 and 10:17:06. The updates primarily focused on the styling and layout of the login form, incorporating Vuetify components for visual elements and responsive design.  The code includes functionality for Active Directory (AD) login and password reset.  There were also multiple updates to this file indicating iterative development and UI improvements. The existence of commented-out code indicates potential features that were explored but ultimately removed or temporarily disabled.


## 11:36:19
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 10:31:50 and 10:51:25 on October 4, 2025.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, specifically focusing on styling and layout adjustments within the employee management section. There are no significant functional changes apparent in the code snippets provided. The minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing around colons) suggest iterative improvements rather than substantial feature additions.

The file `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue` was also updated twice, at 10:53:59 and 10:54:19 on the same day. These changes pertain to the application's login page.  The first update at 10:53:59 appears to be a partial commit, indicated by the "<<<<<<< Updated upstream" marker in the code, suggesting a merge conflict resolution. The second update at 10:54:19 likely completes the merge, finalizing changes to the login page's visual presentation and potentially adding or modifying elements of the login form itself.  The updates include changes to images used and some text alterations to welcome messages.


## 13:36:20
The log shows modifications to two Vue.js files: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/EOS/final_settlement.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/eos/index.vue`.  The changes span from 12:40 PM to 13:25 PM on October 4th, 2025.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/EOS/final_settlement.vue` underwent multiple revisions, primarily focused on the `downloadPDF_payslip` method. This method generates a PDF document containing an employee's end-of-service settlement details.  The most significant changes involved correcting the field name "employement_type" to "employment_type" and moving the "Employent Type" field in the PDF to its correct position.  Minor adjustments were made to the placement of certain fields within the PDF's layout across various revisions.  The core functionality of generating the PDF remained consistent; however, the accuracy and presentation of the information improved throughout the revisions.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/eos/index.vue`  primarily received updates to improve the user interface.  Specifically, the component's structure was refined, leading to cleaner layout and potentially enhanced user experience. One key change was the update of  "employement_type" to "employment_type" in the displayed employee information, consistent with changes made to  `final_settlement.vue`.  No major structural or functional changes are observable from the log provided.


## 16:15:07
The provided code represents the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file, showing two revisions at 15:46:36 and 15:46:57 on October 4th, 2025.  Both revisions are virtually identical; there are no discernible code changes between the two timestamps.

The file is an Express.js API route handler for user-related endpoints. It utilizes several libraries including `bcryptjs`, `@sendgrid/mail`, AWS SDK, `ioredis` (Redis client), `crypto-js`, and `speakeasy`.  The code interacts with MongoDB (using `UsersModel`, `AttendanceModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `NotificationLogsModel`), likely for user data management, attendance tracking, and configuration settings.  There are various endpoints for retrieving user data, including those requiring authentication (`validateToken`) and secret key validation (`validateSecretKey`).

A notable feature is the `/client-dashboards` POST endpoint, which performs complex MongoDB aggregations to retrieve dashboard data, calculating totals for attendance, claims, letters, leaves, and WFH requests for a given client and date.  This endpoint uses multiple `$lookup`, `$match`, `$group`, `$project` and `$cond` operations within the aggregation pipeline.


The `/setup` endpoint encrypts and stores user and configuration data in Redis using `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt` and the `SECRET_KEY` from environment variables.  Other endpoints provide different filtered views of user data based on parameters like `hideProfile` and `user_status`  or ID parameters.  Several endpoints appear to be commented out or redundant.


## 17:15:07
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/users.js` file underwent modifications on October 4th, 2025.  The changes between 16:39:37 and 16:44:27 appear to be insignificant as the code remains largely identical in both versions shown. The file is an Express.js API route handler for user-related actions.

The code uses several libraries including `bcryptjs`, `@sendgrid/mail`, `aws-sdk`, `ioredis`, `crypto-js`, and `speakeasy`, suggesting functionalities related to password hashing, email sending, AWS integration, Redis caching, encryption, and potentially time-based one-time password (TOTP) generation.  It interacts with several MongoDB models (`UsersModel`, `AttendanceModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `NotificationLogsModel`), indicating a database-driven application.

The primary update concerns API endpoints.  A significant portion of the code deals with a `/client-dashboards` POST endpoint which performs complex MongoDB aggregations to fetch dashboard data, including attendance, requests (claims, letters), leaves, and WFH details. This aggregation involves multiple `$lookup`, `$match`, `$group`, and `$project` stages.

Other endpoints include: `/setup` (for encrypting and storing user and configuration data in Redis), `/no-validation/all`, `/crypto-val/:_id` (both seemingly for user retrieval with secret key validation), `/global-dashboard/all` (retrieving active users and attendance count), and various GET endpoints (`/all`, `leaveupdate/all`, `/hide-profile/all`, `/active`, `/active-only`) for retrieving users with varying filters and authentication.  The `/setup` endpoint utilizes AES encryption with a secret key stored in the environment. Many endpoints use `validateToken` and `validateSecretKey` middleware for security.  There is evidence of commented-out code, suggesting some endpoints may be in development or have been temporarily disabled.
