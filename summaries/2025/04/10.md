# Activity Summary for 10/04/2025

## 10:27:48
The log shows several code modifications across two Vue.js components: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/payslips/view/_id.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`, and one Vue.js page: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue`.  The changes span a period from 09:27:42 to 10:23:55 on October 4th, 2025.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/payslips/view/_id.vue`: This file, updated at 09:27:42,  is a Vue component for viewing payslips. The code displays employee details (name, ID, phone, email, etc.) and provides a tabbed interface for selecting payslips by year.  It uses Vuetify components extensively for layout and styling, and fetches data using `asyncData` for user information and payslip data via API calls. The component also includes custom methods for data formatting and manipulation.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`: This component, updated multiple times between 09:49:58 and 10:23:55,  manages the display and filtering of employees.  Significant changes involved adding a section for displaying the number of male and female employees along with their percentages, and implementing an advanced search functionality using Vuetify's `v-text-field`, `v-select`, and `v-chip` components. The component allows exporting employee information and documents to excel using the `download-excel` component. The functionality to add new users is also present.  The multiple updates to this file suggest iterative development and refinement of the filtering and display features.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue`: This login page underwent several revisions between 10:08:34 and 10:17:06. The updates primarily focused on the styling and layout of the login form, incorporating Vuetify components for visual elements and responsive design.  The code includes functionality for Active Directory (AD) login and password reset.  There were also multiple updates to this file indicating iterative development and UI improvements. The existence of commented-out code indicates potential features that were explored but ultimately removed or temporarily disabled.


## 11:36:19
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 10:31:50 and 10:51:25 on October 4, 2025.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, specifically focusing on styling and layout adjustments within the employee management section. There are no significant functional changes apparent in the code snippets provided. The minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing around colons) suggest iterative improvements rather than substantial feature additions.

The file `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/chanel-admin/pages/index.vue` was also updated twice, at 10:53:59 and 10:54:19 on the same day. These changes pertain to the application's login page.  The first update at 10:53:59 appears to be a partial commit, indicated by the "<<<<<<< Updated upstream" marker in the code, suggesting a merge conflict resolution. The second update at 10:54:19 likely completes the merge, finalizing changes to the login page's visual presentation and potentially adding or modifying elements of the login form itself.  The updates include changes to images used and some text alterations to welcome messages.
