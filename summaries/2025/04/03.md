# Activity Summary for 03/04/2025

## 12:29:50
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/reports.js` file underwent multiple revisions on March 4, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: retrieving monthly report data.  If a report exists for the requested month, it's returned; otherwise, a new report is generated for the current month (but not saved).

The key changes involved enhancements to the report generation logic.  Specifically,  multiple updates were made between 11:41:36 and 12:09:06. These edits focused on calculating and adding various metrics to the generated report, such as:


* **Employee Demographics:** Total employees, male/female counts and percentages, and department-wise male/female distribution.
* **Document Expiry:** Tracking of expired passports, Emirates IDs, visas, and insurance for each employee.
* **Pending Requests:** Counts of pending claims, letters, leaves, attendance requests, and WFH requests.
* **Employee Turnover:**  Calculations for monthly exited and new employees and percentage change in exited employees between consecutive months.
* **Average Contract Tenure:** Calculation of average contract tenure per department.


Importantly, a `PayrollModel` was added as a dependency at 12:07:49, suggesting potential future integration of payroll data into reports.  The majority of modifications were minor adjustments and likely related to debugging or refining calculations, as evidenced by the numerous timestamps clustered around 11:58 and 12:02.  No significant structural alterations were made to the code.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reports/bi-report.vue` between 13:03:22 and 13:06:30 on 03/04/2025.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements to a Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing reports.  No significant structural changes are evident; instead, the modifications focus on the UI elements within the report display and filtering sections.  Specifically, there are adjustments to styling, likely involving spacing, alignment, and visual presentation using Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-list`, `v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-chip`, `v-select`, `v-img`).  There is also consistent use of  styling classes such as `darkBlue-heading-text` and `grey-heading-text` suggesting a consistent theme. The repetitive nature of the code suggests that small adjustments to the layout, possibly related to responsiveness or fine-tuning of elements' appearance, were being made during this period.
