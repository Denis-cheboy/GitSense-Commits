# Activity Summary for 03/04/2025

## 12:29:50
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/reports.js` file underwent multiple revisions on March 4, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: retrieving monthly report data.  If a report exists for the requested month, it's returned; otherwise, a new report is generated for the current month (but not saved).

The key changes involved enhancements to the report generation logic.  Specifically,  multiple updates were made between 11:41:36 and 12:09:06. These edits focused on calculating and adding various metrics to the generated report, such as:


* **Employee Demographics:** Total employees, male/female counts and percentages, and department-wise male/female distribution.
* **Document Expiry:** Tracking of expired passports, Emirates IDs, visas, and insurance for each employee.
* **Pending Requests:** Counts of pending claims, letters, leaves, attendance requests, and WFH requests.
* **Employee Turnover:**  Calculations for monthly exited and new employees and percentage change in exited employees between consecutive months.
* **Average Contract Tenure:** Calculation of average contract tenure per department.


Importantly, a `PayrollModel` was added as a dependency at 12:07:49, suggesting potential future integration of payroll data into reports.  The majority of modifications were minor adjustments and likely related to debugging or refining calculations, as evidenced by the numerous timestamps clustered around 11:58 and 12:02.  No significant structural alterations were made to the code.


## 13:29:40
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reports/bi-report.vue` between 13:03:22 and 13:06:30 on 03/04/2025.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements to a Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing reports.  No significant structural changes are evident; instead, the modifications focus on the UI elements within the report display and filtering sections.  Specifically, there are adjustments to styling, likely involving spacing, alignment, and visual presentation using Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-list`, `v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-chip`, `v-select`, `v-img`).  There is also consistent use of  styling classes such as `darkBlue-heading-text` and `grey-heading-text` suggesting a consistent theme. The repetitive nature of the code suggests that small adjustments to the layout, possibly related to responsiveness or fine-tuning of elements' appearance, were being made during this period.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/reports.js` file underwent multiple revisions on March 4, 2025, between 12:35 PM and 1:14 PM.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout: retrieving monthly report data. If data for the requested month exists, it's returned; otherwise, a new report is generated for the current month.  This new report doesn't get saved to the database.

The changes primarily involved refinements in the generation of the monthly report.  Specifically, there were minor adjustments to the logic and structure of calculating and assembling various report metrics.  These metrics include:

* **Employee demographics:** Total employees, male/female counts and percentages.
* **Departmental distribution:** Male and female counts per department.
* **Average contract tenure:** Calculated for each department, considering both active and terminated employees.
* **Employee turnover:** Number of exited and new employees for the current month. Percentage change in exited employees compared to the previous month.
* **Document expiry:** Tracking the number of expired passports, Emirates IDs, visas, and insurance documents along with the information for each expired document.
* **Pending requests:** Counts of pending claims, letters, leaves, attendance, and WFH requests.

The code consistently uses `mongoose` for database interactions, `lodash` for string manipulation (`toLower`), and `Promise.all` for efficient parallel processing of aggregation queries across different models (`usersModel`, `configModel`, `requestsModel`, `leavesModel`, `wfhModel`). There were no substantial structural changes to the code, with the modifications focusing on data processing and calculations within the report generation logic.  The timestamps show a pattern of frequent, relatively small updates during the period.


## 14:52:55
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reports/bi-report.vue` between 13:58:39 and 14:10:28 on March 4, 2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining the UI of a report section within a Vue.js application.  There is a consistent structure throughout the code, using Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, etc.) to create forms and display lists of reports.  The UI elements heavily rely on images (`v-img`) for icons, and styling is applied using inline styles and classes (e.g.,  `darkBlue-heading-text`, `subHeadingFontSize`, `grey-heading-text`).  The code also features a search field, report selection, and dialogs for adding and downloading reports, indicating a user interface for report management. The most significant changes seem to occur in close succession around 14:03:01, with minor formatting and structural adjustments in the subsequent commits.  No functional changes are readily apparent, suggesting the focus is on improving the visual presentation and user experience.


## 15:52:51
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/reports/bi-report.vue`  between 15:25:19 and 15:34:17 on 03/04/2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining a Vue.js component for report generation and display.  There is a significant amount of UI-related code involving elements like `<v-card>`, `<v-list>`, `<v-text-field>`, `<v-dialog>`, `<v-img>`, `<v-select>`, and `<v-chip>`, suggesting a visually rich interface for report management. The component includes features for searching reports, adding new reports (with fields for name, description, and access rights), downloading reports, and an advanced filtering system based on various criteria like status, company, department, team, gender, nationality, line manager, designation, work location, employment type, cost center, and date of joining.  The code remains largely consistent across all updates; no major structural changes are observed.  The timestamps suggest a period of iterative development and refinement of the report interface.


## 16:52:49
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue` between 16:43:26 and 16:45:36 on 03/04/2025.  These updates primarily focus on the payslip download page's functionality and user interface.  The changes involve refining the password validation process and enhancing the Okta integration.  Initially, password validation appears to be directly comparing the entered password with the user's employee ID. This is later changed to making an API call to validate against a unique password. The Okta integration utilizes PKCE for authorization, redirecting the user to Okta for authentication and subsequently retrieving user information via an API call.  The page displays payslips using pagination and provides a preview and download functionality. The UI includes visual enhancements, such as company logos and styling, improving the overall user experience.


## 16:52:54
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/reports.js` file underwent multiple revisions on March 4th, 2025, between 15:56 and 16:33.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout:  a GET endpoint (`/monthly-report-data/:_current_month`) retrieves monthly report data. If data for the requested month exists, it's returned; otherwise, a new report is generated.

The report generation involves several parallel aggregation queries across different MongoDB models (`usersModel`, `configModel`, `requestsModel`, `leavesModel`, `wfhModel`).  These queries fetch employee information, department details, pending requests, leaves, and WFH data.

The generated report includes:

* **Employee Demographics:** Total employees, male/female counts and percentages.
* **Departmental Distribution:** Male and female employee counts per department.
* **Average Contract Tenure:** Calculated per department.
* **Employee Turnover:** Number of exited and new employees for the month, and percentage change in exited employees compared to the previous month.
* **Document Expiry:** Count of expired passports, Emirates IDs, visas, and insurance policies, along with the details of employees with expired documents.
* **Pending Requests:** Count of pending claims, letters, leaves, attendance requests, and WFH requests.


No significant changes in functionality were observed across the multiple commits, only minor, likely inconsequential variations in the code.  The timestamps suggest rapid iterative development and testing of the report generation logic.
