# Activity Summary for 23/04/2025

## 11:12:17
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` between 10:39:08 and 10:49:06 on April 23, 2025.  The core functionality involves generating payslips using the `pdfkit` library and fetching data from various sources including a MongoDB database (`Payslips`, `Companies`, `User`, `CoreConfig`, `PayrollConfig`).

The most significant changes are concentrated in the `getUserPayslipByIDService` function.  Initially, this function had incomplete `try...catch` blocks and lacked error handling.  Over the course of several revisions (between 10:39:08 and 10:49:06), the error handling was improved, and the function was enhanced to fetch data from a Fayolle payroll API (`https://fayolleapi.nathanhr.ae/payslips/user-payslips/${user.payroll_user_id}`) if a `payroll_user_id` exists in the user document. This integration with the Fayolle API is the most substantial change, and was added in multiple steps. The final version includes robust error handling for the Fayolle API call.  The changes were made in short bursts, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  The `console.log` statements were also updated for better debugging information.


The `getPayslipURL` function remains largely unchanged throughout the log, focusing on formatting monetary values and generating a PDF payslip using data retrieved from the database.  It consistently uses `axios` for making API requests to fetch company logos.

The other service functions (`getUserPayslipByMonthService`, `getUserPayslipByMonthAndCompanyService`) show no changes, indicating they are stable components.

The `.env` file shows updates relating to AWS credentials (`SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `ACCESS_KEY`), bucket names (`BUCKET_NAME`, `BUCKET_NAME_DEFAULT`), and API URLs for various services, including the Fayolle payroll API and notification microservice.  These changes likely reflect updates to the application's environment and dependencies.
