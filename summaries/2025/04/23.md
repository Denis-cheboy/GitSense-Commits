# Activity Summary for 23/04/2025

## 11:12:17
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` between 10:39:08 and 10:49:06 on April 23, 2025.  The core functionality involves generating payslips using the `pdfkit` library and fetching data from various sources including a MongoDB database (`Payslips`, `Companies`, `User`, `CoreConfig`, `PayrollConfig`).

The most significant changes are concentrated in the `getUserPayslipByIDService` function.  Initially, this function had incomplete `try...catch` blocks and lacked error handling.  Over the course of several revisions (between 10:39:08 and 10:49:06), the error handling was improved, and the function was enhanced to fetch data from a Fayolle payroll API (`https://fayolleapi.nathanhr.ae/payslips/user-payslips/${user.payroll_user_id}`) if a `payroll_user_id` exists in the user document. This integration with the Fayolle API is the most substantial change, and was added in multiple steps. The final version includes robust error handling for the Fayolle API call.  The changes were made in short bursts, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  The `console.log` statements were also updated for better debugging information.


The `getPayslipURL` function remains largely unchanged throughout the log, focusing on formatting monetary values and generating a PDF payslip using data retrieved from the database.  It consistently uses `axios` for making API requests to fetch company logos.

The other service functions (`getUserPayslipByMonthService`, `getUserPayslipByMonthAndCompanyService`) show no changes, indicating they are stable components.

The `.env` file shows updates relating to AWS credentials (`SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `ACCESS_KEY`), bucket names (`BUCKET_NAME`, `BUCKET_NAME_DEFAULT`), and API URLs for various services, including the Fayolle payroll API and notification microservice.  These changes likely reflect updates to the application's environment and dependencies.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/models/users.model.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/controllers/payslips.controller.js` files between 11:16 AM and 12:11 PM on April 23, 2025.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/services/payslips.service.js` file underwent several iterations.  Early revisions focused on fetching payslips using  `axios` calls to `https://fayolleapi.nathanhr.ae/payslips/user-payslips/` and  local database queries (`Payslips.find`, `Payslips.aggregate`).  A significant change around 12:08 PM involved setting a default value for `defaultLogo` to a direct URL "https://fayolle.s3.amazonaws.com/companies/Fayolle%20logo_CMYK_papier.jpg", suggesting a shift from dynamic logo fetching. The  `getPayslipURL` function consistently generates payslips in PDF format using the `pdfkit` library. The function retrieves data from various models (`Payslips`, `User`, `CoreConfig`, `Companies`, `PayrollConfig`) to populate the payslip PDF. Minor changes in logging statements are observed in this file.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/models/users.model.js` file shows the definition of a user schema using Mongoose.  The schema includes extensive user information, including personal details, employment details, banking information, and various access controls.  Pre-save hooks are implemented to hash passwords using `bcryptjs`. Methods for generating different JWT tokens (access, refresh, reset password) are defined, along with methods for session management and role checking.  No content changes are seen, only the timestamp changed.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-mcs-api/src/controllers/payslips.controller.js` file contains several controller functions for handling payslip-related requests.  These functions use the `payslipsService` for data access and `loggerService` for logging. The `getUserPayslipByID` function was updated around 11:31 AM to improve error handling in the response, providing more specific error messages including `error.message`, `error.code`, and `error.response?.status`. Other functions (`getUserPayslipByMonth`, `getUserPayslipByMonthAndCompany`, `getPayslipURL`, `sendEmail`) handle different payslip requests and log requests and errors using `loggerService`. The `updateDesignationBankend` function performs a batch update operation to update designations in the `Payslips` collection by mapping data from `Users` and `CoreConfig` collections.


Overall, the changes reflect ongoing development of a payslip generation and management system, focusing on improvements to data fetching, error handling, and logging.  The shift to a hardcoded default logo URL in `payslips.service.js` is a notable change.  The consistent structure and error handling in the controller functions indicate a focus on maintainability and robustness.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/fayolle-api/api/payslips.js` file, last updated on 23/04/2025 at 12:37:14, is a Node.js Express.js API for managing payslips.  It uses several models (`PayslipsModel`, `UsersModel`, `PayrollProcessModel`) and external libraries including `sendgrid`, `AWS SES`, `moment`, and `number-to-words`. The API provides endpoints for various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on payslips.

Key features include:

* **Data Retrieval:** Endpoints to retrieve all payslips, payslips by user ID, payslips by pay month, distinct pay months, and a single payslip by ID.  There's redundancy with two `/:_id` GET routes.
* **Data Modification:** Endpoints to update a payslip by ID, add a new payslip, add multiple payslips (`/add-many`), and delete a payslip by ID.  A commented-out section suggests a more complex batch payslip creation process, linking payslips to users and payroll processes, including formatting total salary into words.  An endpoint `/add-many/updatingpayslips/designation` updates the `company_id` field in existing payslips based on data from the `UsersModel`.
* **Authentication & Authorization:**  Uses `validateToken` and `validateSecretKey` middleware for authentication and authorization on several endpoints.
* **Email Functionality:** Includes an endpoint (`/send-email`) to send emails, likely for payslip notifications.  The email recipients (`email`, `nathan_email`, `hr_email`, `approver_email`) are configurable.
* **Error Handling:**  Generally includes `try...catch` blocks for error handling, returning appropriate error messages to the client.


The commented-out section represents a substantial piece of logic that was potentially removed or replaced, suggesting a major code refactoring at some point.  The overall structure suggests a well-organized API built to handle various aspects of payslip management.  The use of AWS SES and SendGrid implies a production-level system.  The API uses MongoDB for data storage.
