# Activity Summary for 27/05/2025

## 10:31:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js`  between 09:37:19 and 10:08:07 on May 27, 2025.  These updates primarily involve refining the API endpoints for managing payroll processes.  Notably, there's a consistent pattern of adding error handling (`try...catch` blocks) around database interactions.  The file uses `PayrollProcessModel` extensively for database operations, including `find`, `distinct`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, and `findOneAndUpdate`. Several endpoints handle various GET requests for retrieving payroll process data, filtering by pay month, user ID, status, and other parameters.  POST requests are used for adding new payroll processes and generating missing pay items from recursive data. A significant change was adding a `submitForApproval` endpoint which updates a payroll process and includes logic for email triggering and notification updates.  The changes also involve improvements in error handling and response formatting.  There were also multiple updates to the `.env` file during this time period, which seem to involve database connection strings and API keys, which are not included in this summary.  Finally, between 10:00:23 and 10:08:07, a small but consequential change was made in `payrollprocess.js`, specifically uncommenting and enabling the `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` within the AWS SES configuration.  This suggests that AWS access was initially commented out and then later activated, potentially indicating a change in deployment or security settings.
