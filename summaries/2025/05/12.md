# Activity Summary for 12/05/2025

## 11:21:19
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/app.js` on December 5th, 2025.  The core functionality of the Express.js application remains consistent throughout all revisions. The changes are primarily focused around minor timing adjustments and no functional alterations are made to the code. The timestamps of the modifications cluster between 11:02:54 and 11:19:58, indicating frequent, short bursts of edits.  The code consistently includes various middleware for security (helmet, xss), data sanitization (commented-out mongoSanitize), compression, CORS handling, JWT authentication using passport.js, file uploads (express-fileupload), and error handling.  A noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of a large, hardcoded array (`usersData`) containing employee data which remains unchanged across all revisions.  This suggests this data might be better managed through a database rather than hardcoding within the application code.
