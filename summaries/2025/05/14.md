# Activity Summary for 14/05/2025

## 11:14:29
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` file underwent several revisions on May 14th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: managing payroll processes via various HTTP methods.  The changes primarily focused on the `/submitForApproval` and `/closeSalarySheet` routes.


**Key Changes Over Time:**

* **10:17:51:** Initial version of the file, containing numerous GET, PUT, and POST routes for interacting with payroll processes.  These routes handled actions like retrieving all payroll processes, retrieving processes by pay month, adding new payroll items, and retrieving specific payroll processes using their IDs.

* **10:18:05 - 10:39:43:** Multiple minor revisions.  The most significant changes happened within the `submitForApproval` and `closeSalarySheet` routes.  These revisions involved adding or refining email triggers on submission and closure of salary sheets.  Specifically, the email subject line was enhanced to include the company's group name.  There were also incremental refinements to data handling and error management within the `/closeSalarySheet` route, with several parameters being commented out to remove them or reduce their impact.


**Specific Route Updates:**

The `/submitForApproval` route evolved to include:

*   Checking for pending payitems before submission.
*   Pushing history objects to track actions.
*   Sending emails to salary sheet approvers with a URL to approve.  The email subject now includes the group name from the Configuration model.
*  Adding a notification to the NotificationLogsModel.

The `/closeSalarySheet` route was updated to:

* Improve error handling.
* Set the `status` to "inactive" and update the `closedDate`.
* Remove or comment out several parameters reducing the complexity of handling parameters in the route.

**Recurring Elements:**

The code consistently uses `async/await` for asynchronous operations, utilizes error handling (`try...catch` blocks), and relies on the `moment` library for date manipulation. The `validateToken` middleware is frequently used for authentication on most routes.  The code extensively uses MongoDB models (`PayrollProcessModel`, `PayrollModel`, `UsersModel`, `ConfigurationModel`), suggesting a database-driven application.  Data is frequently retrieved and updated using these models.


## 11:14:57
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` on May 14, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the user interface for payroll management.  No significant structural changes are observed, but several functional improvements are made over a short time period.

The earliest revisions (10:43:31, 10:45:07, 10:46:16, 10:46:28, 10:47:59, 10:48:23)  appear to be incremental, with no noticeable differences in functionality between them.  These edits likely involved minor UI adjustments, bug fixes, or code cleanup.


A more substantial change is introduced at 10:56:10, where a `:disabled="btnStatus"` attribute is added to the "Submit for Approval" button. This suggests the addition of functionality to control the button's enabled/disabled state based on the `btnStatus` variable.


The final two entries (11:07:32 and 11:07:39) are almost identical, suggesting a minor, insignificant update, possibly related to whitespace or formatting.  Throughout the log, the code consistently uses Vue.js components (like `<v-card>`, `<v-btn>`, `<v-dialog>`, etc.), indicating a Vue.js-based frontend application.  The code also handles payroll status (`payrollprocesses[0].status`), approval workflows, and employee data display.


## 12:14:11
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` file between 11:32:17 and 12:13:42 on May 14, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughoutâ€”handling payroll processing via various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT).  The code uses Express.js for routing, SendGrid for email, and interacts with several MongoDB models (`PayrollProcessModel`, `PayslipsModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `RecursiveModel`, `UsersModel`, `PayrollModel`, `NotificationLogsModel`, `NotificationsModel`).  AWS SES is included for email sending, though API keys are omitted from the log.

The primary changes observed are related to the `NotificationsModel`. Initially, the code references `notificationModel` and `NotificationLogsModel` inconsistently and possibly incorrectly.  The changes between 11:38:33 and 11:40:27 reflect a refactoring where the code is consistently using `NotificationsModel`  instead of `notificationModel`  for handling notifications.  There were several small changes including one fixing a typo in the `approveSalarySheet` route at 11:46:44 where approver_id was incorrectly used as a function instead of a direct comparison.  After 11:40:27, the code remains consistent with only minor differences in spacing or commented code. The  `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` routes manage payroll submission and approval workflows, including email notifications and updates to the database.  These routes handle logic for checking pending pay items, updating payroll process status, sending approval emails, and creating notification logs.


## 12:14:14
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` on May 14, 2025.  All revisions appear to be minor adjustments to the existing Vue.js component, focused on UI elements and conditional rendering.  There are no substantial structural changes or additions of major features across the revisions.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense activity around 11:18 AM, 11:22 AM, and then again around 11:43 AM. The code consistently deals with payroll processes, approval workflows, and displaying payroll data, suggesting incremental improvements or bug fixes within a payroll management application.  There is extensive use of Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, etc.) for building the user interface.  The recurring use of `payrollprocesses[0]` implies that the component primarily focuses on a single payroll process at a time.  The conditional rendering based on `payrollprocesses[0].status` ('active' or 'inactive') and `payrollprocesses[0].submit_for_approval` manages the UI according to the payroll process's state.  The code also includes functionality for email notifications to managers.


## 12:51:16
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ilf-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file was updated on 14/05/2025 at 12:10:37.  This update significantly modifies the UI for payroll processing.  The changes center around a `v-data-table` displaying payroll sheets, incorporating numerous interactive elements based on the payroll run's status (`active`, `inactive`), type (`Monthly`, `Supplementary`), and approval status (`submit_for_approval`).

Specifically, the update adds functionality for:

* **Generating supplementary payroll cycles:** A button allows generating supplementary payroll cycles (conditional on user roles: `isSuperAdminRole` or `isAdminRole`).
* **Adding new pay items:**  Conditional rendering uses `AddNewPayitem` and `AddNewPayitemOffCycle` components for adding pay items to monthly and supplementary payroll runs respectively.  This is gated by user roles and the payroll run's status and type.
* **Downloading JV Reports:**  Buttons allow downloading Journal Voucher reports for monthly and supplementary payroll runs.
* **Approval workflow:**  The code implements a complex approval process with buttons for submitting for approval, viewing pending approval requests (`pendingApprovalBadge`), approving, and rejecting payroll runs.  These actions are conditional on user roles, payroll run status and type.
* **Withholding employee salary:**  A button allows withholding an employee's salary, again controlled by user roles and payroll run status.
* **Downloading SIF (presumably Salary Information File):** A download button for a SIF is added, accessible to administrators after approval.


The code extensively uses Vue.js components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-data-table`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-tooltip`, `v-chip`, `v-badge`) and conditional rendering (`v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-for`) to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.  The data table displays information such as creation date (`createdDate`), type, status, and provides actions specific to each payroll run's state.  Error handling and edge cases (e.g., disabled buttons) are also implemented throughout the code.


## 13:14:10
The log shows several code changes across various files within the `ikea-api` project on May 14, 2025.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js`  was updated at 12:22:28. This file contains numerous API endpoints for managing payroll processes.  The endpoints utilize the `PayrollProcessModel` to handle GET and PUT requests for retrieving, updating, and adding payroll process data.  Specific functionalities include retrieving all payroll processes, filtering by pay month,  retrieving active and inactive processes, and handling submissions for approval.  The code uses SendGrid for email notifications and AWS SES for sending emails, also utilizing  models like `PayslipsModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `RecursiveModel`, `UsersModel`, `PayrollModel`, `NotificationLogsModel` and `NotificationsModel`.  A significant addition is the `/submitForApproval` and `/approveSalarySheet` routes, which handle salary sheet submission and approval workflows, including email notifications.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/helper/user_update_watch.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/helper/attendance_update_watcher.js` were updated at 12:44:55 and 12:45:09 respectively. Both files contain commented-out code suggesting the implementation of change streams for users and attendance data.  The commented-out code uses Redis for caching data after encryption with a secret key from the environment variables.  `attendance_update_watcher.js` also includes commented-out code for handling late attendance notifications via email using AWS SES.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/users.js` was updated at 12:49:59.  This file contains API routes for managing user data, including fetching user information, getting work locations, and managing special access tags.  It utilizes  `UsersModel`, `Logging`, `SendGrid`, AWS SDK for SES, and Redis for caching, and also leverages functions from a `utils` file for token validation.  The code also includes functionalities for client dashboards, retrieving limited user information based on specific filters, and updating user access.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/models/users.js` was updated twice, at 12:50:19 and 12:50:28, with minor changes between the two commits.  The file defines the Mongoose schema for the `UsersModel`.  It includes various user attributes (personal information, employment details, roles, security settings etc.), pre-save hooks for password hashing, and methods for generating JWTs, managing sessions, and checking user roles. The schema also includes fields for storing multiple tokens (`tokens` and `fb_tokens`), unsuccessful login attempts and details, and access tags and work access.


A common pattern across the updated files is the extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`),  the utilization of various Mongoose models for database interaction, and the integration of AWS SES and SendGrid for email notifications.  The use of Redis for caching is also present in two files, although the implementation is currently commented out.  There is a consistent use of environment variables for sensitive information such as API keys and database connection strings.


## 13:14:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 12:15 PM and 13:14 PM on May 14, 2025.  The code consistently displays a Vue.js component for managing payroll, featuring various interactive elements.  No significant code changes are observable across the different commits during this timeframe. The repeated commits suggest minor adjustments or refinements were made, possibly involving debugging or styling tweaks rather than major functional changes.  The component includes features for approving/rejecting payroll processes, submitting for approval, closing sheets, sending emails to managers, displaying employee payslips, and showing pay item details (earnings and deductions). The UI is built using Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-tabs`).


## 14:39:00
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file, updated on 14/05/2025 at 13:14:24, is a Vue.js component managing payroll processes.  The component features a user interface for approving or rejecting payroll submissions, submitting for approval, viewing approvers' information, closing payroll sheets, and sending emails to managers.  It displays various payroll data including earnings and deductions, and offers functionalities to view salary sheets, pay items, and access logs. The UI uses Vuetify components extensively for buttons, dialogs, cards, and data display.  Conditional rendering based on payroll status ('active' or 'inactive') and user roles is prominent.  Specific features include:

* **Approval/Rejection:** Buttons to approve or reject payroll submissions, along with a dialog to input comments.
* **Submission for Approval:** A dialog confirming submission to approvers.
* **Approver Information:** Displays details of approvers (name, status, date, comments) using avatars and information fetched using `services_general.getImage` and `services_general.getUserName`.
* **Closing Payroll Sheets:**  A confirmation dialog and functionality to close the sheet.  Indicates successful closure with an alert.
* **Email Functionality:** Buttons to send emails to the manager, with options for standard and recursive email.
* **Salary Sheet Display:** Shows a summary of the payroll with expandable details including earnings and deductions.  Uses a `DataTable` component.  Allows for switching between a full and a condensed view of the salary sheet.
* **Pay Item Management:**  Tabs to display pending, approved, and canceled pay items.  A link to the `/payitems` page is provided.
* **User-specific access control:** Many UI elements have visibility controlled by the `payrollprocesses[0].status` (active/inactive) and employee ID (`user.emp_id`).


The code makes heavy use of Vue.js features like `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-model`, and computed properties.  The data is likely fetched from a backend service and processed by the `services_general` object.  Error handling and loading states are not explicitly visible in this snippet.


## 14:39:04
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` on May 14, 2025.  The file is a Node.js Express.js API endpoint for managing payroll processes.  Key changes involve the `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` POST routes.

Initially, the code lacked the `moment` library import and the AWS SES configuration was commented out.  Between 13:16:08 and 13:35:26, the AWS SES configuration was uncommented and populated with environment variables (`process.env.SECRET_ID_AWS`, `process.env.SECRET_KEY_AWS`).  The `moment` library was added at 13:47:12, enabling date formatting in the email notifications sent through the `submitForApproval` route.  Around the same time (13:46:19 - 13:47:50), there were minor edits, likely for debugging purposes, including adding `console.log` statements to track the `user` object and `config` object in the `submitForApproval` route.

A significant change occurred at 13:57:07, where the hardcoded group name ("IKEA") in the email body was changed from `config[0].GROUP_NAME.toUpperCase()` to a simple "IKEA" string.  This suggests simplification of the email configuration, possibly moving away from dynamically retrieving the group name. The subsequent edits (13:57:22 and 13:57:28) appear to be minor refinements or debugging attempts related to the email sending process and the `config` object.

Throughout the revisions, the core functionality of the APIâ€”handling various GET requests for retrieving payroll data and PUT/POST requests for updating and adding payroll itemsâ€”remained consistent. The major focus of the changes was refining the email notification system triggered upon submission and approval of salary sheets.
