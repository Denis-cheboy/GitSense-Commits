# Activity Summary for 21/05/2025

## 10:05:46
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file, last updated on 21/05/2025 at 10:04:40, is an Express.js router handling salary adjustment requests.  It uses various models (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`, `PayrollModel`, `PayrollProcessModel`, `configurationModel`, `UsersModel`, `FixedSalaryLogModel`) for database interactions.  The code includes functionalities for:

* **Retrieving salary adjustments:**  GET requests to `/all`, `/user/:user_id`, `/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`, `/get_latest/:id`, and several others fetch salary adjustment data based on different criteria (all adjustments, adjustments by user ID, adjustments by company ID and pay month, latest adjustment for a user, counts of adjustments by status).

* **Adding salary adjustments:** POST requests to `/add-item` and `/add-item-many` create new salary adjustment records.  `/add-item` handles single adjustments, while `/add-item-many` processes multiple adjustments simultaneously.  Both calculate prorated amounts based on effective date and differences between old and new salaries.  The `/add-item-many` endpoint also includes (commented-out) code for a multi-level approval workflow using notifications.

* **Updating salary adjustments:** A PUT request to `/:_id` updates existing salary adjustment records.

* **Counting pending requests:** GET requests to `/pending/:_id` and POST requests to `/get_all_requests_count` and `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy` count pending or completed salary adjustment requests based on different filters.

* **Getting all requests:** POST requests to `/get_all_requests` and `/get_all_requests/:createdBy` retrieve all salary adjustment requests, allowing filtering by status (pending or completed) and creator ID.

The code uses `moment-timezone` for date manipulation, `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending (though the actual sending functionality within the approval workflow appears to be commented out), and `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  A recurring pattern is the use of similar database queries with slight variations in filters for different endpoints.  The code shows a well-structured API for managing salary adjustments, including features for data retrieval, creation, update, and status tracking.
