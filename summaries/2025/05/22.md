# Activity Summary for 22/05/2025

## 10:36:27
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file, last updated on 22/05/2025 at 10:02:26, is an Express.js API endpoint handling salary adjustment requests.  It uses various models (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`, `PayrollModel`, `PayrollProcessModel`, `configurationModel`, `UsersModel`, `FixedSalaryLogModel`) for database interactions.  The code includes functionalities for:

* **Retrieving salary adjustments:**  GET `/all`, `/user/:user_id`, `/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`, `/get_latest/:id`.  These endpoints retrieve salary adjustments based on various criteria (all adjustments, by user ID, by company ID and pay month, and the latest adjustment for a user).  They also provide counts of adjustments based on status (active, pending, withdrawn) via `/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month` and `/get_all_requests_count`, `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`.

* **Adding salary adjustments:** POST `/add-item` (single adjustment) and `/add-item-many` (multiple adjustments).  Both endpoints calculate prorated amounts based on the effective date and differences between old and new salaries.  The `/add-item-many` endpoint also incorporates an approval workflow, though the commented-out section suggests planned notification features were not yet implemented.

* **Updating salary adjustments:** PUT `/:_id` updates a salary adjustment by ID.

* **Retrieving pending requests:** GET `/pending/:_id` counts pending salary adjustment requests for a given user ID.

* **Retrieving all requests:** POST `/get_all_requests` retrieves all salary adjustment requests, allowing filtering by history (all or pending only).  POST `/get_all_requests/:createdBy` allows filtering by the creator or approvers of the requests.

The code utilizes `moment-timezone` for date/time manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending (though the actual sending functionality might be incomplete).  Error handling is present throughout the code using `try...catch` blocks.  A recurring pattern is the use of `validateToken` middleware to secure all routes.  The prorating calculation logic is duplicated in both the single and multiple adjustment endpoints.  The approval workflow is partially implemented in `/add-item-many` but seems to be incomplete at the time of logging.
