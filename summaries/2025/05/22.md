# Activity Summary for 22/05/2025

## 10:36:27
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file, last updated on 22/05/2025 at 10:02:26, is an Express.js API endpoint handling salary adjustment requests.  It uses various models (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`, `PayrollModel`, `PayrollProcessModel`, `configurationModel`, `UsersModel`, `FixedSalaryLogModel`) for database interactions.  The code includes functionalities for:

* **Retrieving salary adjustments:**  GET `/all`, `/user/:user_id`, `/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`, `/get_latest/:id`.  These endpoints retrieve salary adjustments based on various criteria (all adjustments, by user ID, by company ID and pay month, and the latest adjustment for a user).  They also provide counts of adjustments based on status (active, pending, withdrawn) via `/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month` and `/get_all_requests_count`, `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`.

* **Adding salary adjustments:** POST `/add-item` (single adjustment) and `/add-item-many` (multiple adjustments).  Both endpoints calculate prorated amounts based on the effective date and differences between old and new salaries.  The `/add-item-many` endpoint also incorporates an approval workflow, though the commented-out section suggests planned notification features were not yet implemented.

* **Updating salary adjustments:** PUT `/:_id` updates a salary adjustment by ID.

* **Retrieving pending requests:** GET `/pending/:_id` counts pending salary adjustment requests for a given user ID.

* **Retrieving all requests:** POST `/get_all_requests` retrieves all salary adjustment requests, allowing filtering by history (all or pending only).  POST `/get_all_requests/:createdBy` allows filtering by the creator or approvers of the requests.

The code utilizes `moment-timezone` for date/time manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending (though the actual sending functionality might be incomplete).  Error handling is present throughout the code using `try...catch` blocks.  A recurring pattern is the use of `validateToken` middleware to secure all routes.  The prorating calculation logic is duplicated in both the single and multiple adjustment endpoints.  The approval workflow is partially implemented in `/add-item-many` but seems to be incomplete at the time of logging.

The provided code represents a series of changes to an API endpoint (`/salaryAdjustment.js`) handling salary adjustments.  The modifications occurred between 11:28:37 and 11:30:40 on May 22, 2025.  No significant changes to the code's functionality are observed across these revisions; the code remains consistent.  The  `/salaryAdjustment.js` file contains numerous API routes to handle various operations related to salary adjustments.  These include:

* **Data Retrieval:** Routes exist to fetch all salary adjustments (`/all`), adjustments for a specific user (`/user/:user_id`),  adjustments for a given pay month and company (`/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`), the latest adjustment for a user (`/get_latest/:id`), and counts of pending, active, and withdrawn adjustments (`/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month`).  There are also endpoints to retrieve all requests, differentiating between pending and historical requests, optionally filtering by createdBy (`/get_all_requests`, `/get_all_requests/:createdBy`). Count endpoints exist for both the filtered and unfiltered cases (`/get_all_requests_count`, `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`).


* **Data Manipulation:**  The API allows adding a single salary adjustment (`/add-item`) and multiple adjustments in bulk (`/add-item-many`).  It also supports updating existing adjustments (`/:_id`) and retrieving the count of pending adjustments for a given user ID (`/pending/:_id`).

* **Proration Calculation:**  A notable feature is the calculation of prorated amounts for salary adjustments based on the effective date.  This calculation is performed within both the single and bulk add methods.

* **Approval Workflow (Commented Out):** The `/add-item-many` route includes commented-out code suggesting a planned approval workflow using a configuration model to determine approvers and sending notifications.  This workflow is not currently implemented in the committed code.

The overall pattern is a RESTful API designed for managing salary adjustments, including creating, retrieving, updating, and counting records.  The minor timestamps suggest iterative development or bug fixes rather than major functional alterations.  The consistency of the code across the revisions indicates that the changes were likely minor adjustments or refinements rather than substantial rewrites.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file underwent multiple revisions on May 22, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout:  handling salary adjustment requests using various HTTP methods.  These methods include:

* **GET /all:** Retrieves all salary adjustments.
* **POST /add-item:** Adds a single salary adjustment item, calculating prorated amounts based on the `effective_date`, `new_salary`, and `old_salary` fields.
* **POST /add-item-many:** Adds multiple salary adjustment items; this route also interacts with a `configurationModel` to determine and manage an approval workflow (though the approval logic itself is commented out in the code).
* **GET /user/:user_id:** Retrieves salary adjustments for a specific user.
* **PUT /:_id:** Updates a salary adjustment using its ID.
* **GET /pending/:_id:** Counts pending salary adjustments for a given user ID.
* **GET /pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month:** Retrieves salary adjustments for a specific company and pay month.
* **GET /get_latest/:id:** Retrieves the latest salary adjustment for a given user ID.
* **GET /pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month:** Counts salary adjustments (active, pending, withdrawn) for a company and pay month.
* **POST /get_all_requests:** Retrieves all salary adjustment requests, filtering by status (pending or completed).
* **POST /get_all_requests/:createdBy:** Retrieves salary adjustment requests created by or assigned to a specific user.
* **POST /get_all_requests_count:** Counts pending or completed salary adjustment requests.
* **POST /get_all_requests_count/:createdBy:** Counts salary adjustment requests based on creation or assignment to a user.


The code consistently uses `async/await` for database interactions and `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  The most significant changes appear to be minor refinements and no substantial structural alterations are observed across the timestamps. The commented-out section in the `/add-item-many` route suggests future implementation of a notification system for approvals.  All revisions between 11:48:09 and 12:34:11 show identical code.
