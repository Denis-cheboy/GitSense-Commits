# Activity Summary for 26/05/2025

## 11:28:24
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-admin/pages/payroll/` directory, focusing on Vue.js components for payroll management.  All changes between 10:37:39 and 10:41:53  to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-admin/pages/payroll/index.vue` appear to be minor formatting adjustments or insignificant whitespace changes within the same code block, with no functional difference.

A significant change occurred at **10:49:14**  to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`. This file, seemingly responsible for individual payroll processing, was updated to include:

*   **Approval and Rejection Functionality:** Buttons for approving and rejecting payroll items, along with a dialog to confirm submission for approval.
*   **Approver Information Display:** A dialog showing the details (name, status, date, comments) of each approver in the process.
*   **Payslip Generation:** A button and dialog to close the payroll sheet and generate payslips, indicating successful completion.
*   **Detailed Payslip View:**  A component to display an individual employee's payslip, showing earnings and deductions separately, along with employee details like ID, email, designation, department, and IBAN. The component also includes conditional rendering based on `showSalarySheet` and `showFullSheet` flags, suggesting the ability to toggle between a summarized and a full view of the payslip.
*   **Salary Sheet Display:**  A data table (`DataTable`) to show payroll data, with options to expand for more details.  The table displays various fields including pay month, approver, creation date, compensation totals, closed date, and status, all formatted using custom Vue filters (e.g., `PayslipDateFormatter`, `amountFormatter`). The component also uses a chartjs-doughnut for visual representation of data.  Conditional display logic is used to only show this section (`showSalarySheet`) if the payroll process is active.
*   **Pay Item Management:** Links and buttons allow for viewing pending pay items and adding new pay items.

The `/pages/payroll/index.vue` file consistently displays an overview of payroll processes, including buttons to navigate to different sections (approvals, pay items, payslips, etc.), and displays summary statistics (pending approvals, action items).  The overall structure suggests a comprehensive payroll management system with features for creating, managing, approving, and reporting on payroll data.

The log shows two updates to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/.env` file, both within a minute of each other on May 26, 2025.  The file appears to contain environment variables and potentially payroll data.

The first update (10:56:46) includes a single entry of payroll data for Arnold Mbinkar for May 2025.

The second update (10:57:10) adds another entry to the file,  this time containing payroll information for Arnold Mbinkar for April 2025.  Noteworthy is the addition of an `emailsent` field with the value "delivered".

Both entries share the same `user_id`, `company_id`, `emp_id`, `iban`, and `bank_name`, suggesting they refer to the same employee.  The key difference is the pay month and a slightly different formatting of the `total_salary_text` field between the two entries.  The data appears to be a log of payroll processed information.
