# Activity Summary for 16/05/2025

## 11:47:00
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ihs-api/api/payrollprocess.js` file underwent several revisions on May 16th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the `/closeSalarySheet` POST route within the code.  This route handles closing a salary sheet, updating the status to "inactive," adding a history entry, and creating a new payroll process for the following month.


Between 11:25:27 and 11:46:33, several minor modifications were made to the `/closeSalarySheet` endpoint.  Specifically,  the `company_id` field was removed from the `hist_obj`  in the `closeSalarySheet` function. There were also several insignificant changes to commented-out code. The most significant change involves expanding the email recipient list in the email trigger section of this function. Initially, only `dennis.abonda@nathandigital.com` was included; by the final revision, 'spnair@nathanhr.com' and 'akshaf@nathanhr.com' were added.  The rest of the code, encompassing various GET, PUT, and POST requests for managing payroll processes, remained largely consistent throughout these revisions.  These routes handle retrieving payroll data (all, active, by user ID, by process ID, closed), updating existing processes and email status, and adding new payroll items.  The code consistently uses `validateToken` middleware for authentication.  The use of `PayrollProcessModel`, `PayrollModel`, `RecursiveModel`, `ConfigurationModel` and `UsersModel` indicates interaction with a database for persistent storage.
