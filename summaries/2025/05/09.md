# Activity Summary for 09/05/2025

On September 5th, 2025, at 10:39:05, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/app.js` file was updated.  The changes primarily involved configuring an Express.js application.  The update included setting up middleware for security (Helmet), CORS, request timeouts, file uploads (with size limits), JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, and data sanitization (XSS, though mongoSanitize was disabled).  It also integrated  JWT authentication using Passport.js,  applied compression, and configured custom error handling.  The application uses Morgan for logging (though conditionally, based on environment).  A custom middleware adds several security-related HTTP headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.). The routes are defined in a separate `./routes` module.  The application includes a welcome message at the `/v1` endpoint and handles 404 errors.  Rate limiting for authentication endpoints was included in the code but commented out.  A commented-out section suggests there was a placeholder for employee data (likely to be added later).

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` file underwent numerous revisions between 12:00:03 and 12:57:50 on 09/05/2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a Node.js server using Express.js, connecting to a MongoDB database, and incorporating various middleware and API routes.  Key changes focused on the `/` route's functionality.

Initially, the `/` route returned a simple "Hello" message.  Subsequent changes introduced asynchronous calls to the `PayrollModel` to fetch overtime payroll data, filtering by `status`, `pay_month`, and `category`.  The query criteria for `category` evolved over time, adding more overtime categories.  The `pay_month` filter also changed from a single month to a range of months (`2025-01`, `2025-02`, `2025-03`).  A `company_id` filter was added and then later removed.

Further modifications involved:

* **Adding `SalaryAdjustmentModel`:**  A new model (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`) was introduced and incorporated into the `/` route's logic, performing queries to match `payroll_id` and subsequently `user_id` and `pay_month` to retrieve salary adjustment data.
* **Structuring the response:**  The response structure was refined by creating an `overtimePayroll` object to aggregate data from `PayrollModel` and `SalaryAdjustmentModel`, including fields like `emp_id`, `user_full_name`, `country`, `pay_month`, `category`, `overtime_hours`, `overtime_amount`, `old_basic_salary`, and `isSalaryAdjusted`.
* **Error Handling (implicitly):** The code increasingly includes error handling via `console.error` for database connection errors and the use of `await` in database operations.  There is no explicit try-catch for the MongoDB queries but the use of async/await implies a degree of implicit error handling.

The repeated inclusion of numerous API routes (e.g., `/loan`, `/passport`, `/claim`, etc.) suggests a large and feature-rich application.  The consistent use of `mongoose` for database interactions, `express` for routing and middleware, and various other modules (`cors`, `body-parser`, `helmet`, etc.) points to a well-structured project.  The addition of `console.log` statements during development aided in tracking the data flow within the `/` route.  The final version efficiently handles the absence of salary adjustments and populates appropriate data.

The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` file between 13:00:48 and 13:05:23 on 09/05/2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the root  `/` GET route's response. Initially, the route returned a static string. Subsequent updates progressively modify the response to return a JSON array (`payrollReport`) containing overtime payroll data. This data is fetched from the `PayrollModel`, `UsersModel`, and `CompaniesModel`  through asynchronous database queries.  The modifications involve adding logging statements (`console.log`) to track data retrieval at different stages, and the final version includes more robust error handling using optional chaining (`user?._id`) to prevent crashes if `user` is null.

Between 13:23:44 and 13:24:43 on 09/05/2025, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/models/companies.js` file underwent minor corrections. The only substantive change was adding the `type: String` definition to the `country` field within the `companiesSchema`.

Finally, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/users.js` file was updated three times between 13:35:00 and 13:35:17 on 09/05/2025.  These changes seem to involve minor adjustments or corrections to a JSON array representing employee data, possibly related to formatting or content.  The content itself appears to be a large JSON array of employee overtime details.  No significant structural changes are apparent.
