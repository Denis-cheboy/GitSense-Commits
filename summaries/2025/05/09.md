# Activity Summary for 09/05/2025

## 11:07:29
On September 5th, 2025, at 10:39:05, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/app.js` file was updated.  The changes primarily involved configuring an Express.js application.  The update included setting up middleware for security (Helmet), CORS, request timeouts, file uploads (with size limits), JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, and data sanitization (XSS, though mongoSanitize was disabled).  It also integrated  JWT authentication using Passport.js,  applied compression, and configured custom error handling.  The application uses Morgan for logging (though conditionally, based on environment).  A custom middleware adds several security-related HTTP headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.). The routes are defined in a separate `./routes` module.  The application includes a welcome message at the `/v1` endpoint and handles 404 errors.  Rate limiting for authentication endpoints was included in the code but commented out.  A commented-out section suggests there was a placeholder for employee data (likely to be added later).

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` file underwent numerous revisions between 12:00:03 and 12:57:50 on 09/05/2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a Node.js server using Express.js, connecting to a MongoDB database, and incorporating various middleware and API routes.  Key changes focused on the `/` route's functionality.

Initially, the `/` route returned a simple "Hello" message.  Subsequent changes introduced asynchronous calls to the `PayrollModel` to fetch overtime payroll data, filtering by `status`, `pay_month`, and `category`.  The query criteria for `category` evolved over time, adding more overtime categories.  The `pay_month` filter also changed from a single month to a range of months (`2025-01`, `2025-02`, `2025-03`).  A `company_id` filter was added and then later removed.

Further modifications involved:

* **Adding `SalaryAdjustmentModel`:**  A new model (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`) was introduced and incorporated into the `/` route's logic, performing queries to match `payroll_id` and subsequently `user_id` and `pay_month` to retrieve salary adjustment data.
* **Structuring the response:**  The response structure was refined by creating an `overtimePayroll` object to aggregate data from `PayrollModel` and `SalaryAdjustmentModel`, including fields like `emp_id`, `user_full_name`, `country`, `pay_month`, `category`, `overtime_hours`, `overtime_amount`, `old_basic_salary`, and `isSalaryAdjusted`.
* **Error Handling (implicitly):** The code increasingly includes error handling via `console.error` for database connection errors and the use of `await` in database operations.  There is no explicit try-catch for the MongoDB queries but the use of async/await implies a degree of implicit error handling.

The repeated inclusion of numerous API routes (e.g., `/loan`, `/passport`, `/claim`, etc.) suggests a large and feature-rich application.  The consistent use of `mongoose` for database interactions, `express` for routing and middleware, and various other modules (`cors`, `body-parser`, `helmet`, etc.) points to a well-structured project.  The addition of `console.log` statements during development aided in tracking the data flow within the `/` route.  The final version efficiently handles the absence of salary adjustments and populates appropriate data.


## 13:58:43
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` file between 13:00:48 and 13:05:23 on 09/05/2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the root  `/` GET route's response. Initially, the route returned a static string. Subsequent updates progressively modify the response to return a JSON array (`payrollReport`) containing overtime payroll data. This data is fetched from the `PayrollModel`, `UsersModel`, and `CompaniesModel`  through asynchronous database queries.  The modifications involve adding logging statements (`console.log`) to track data retrieval at different stages, and the final version includes more robust error handling using optional chaining (`user?._id`) to prevent crashes if `user` is null.

Between 13:23:44 and 13:24:43 on 09/05/2025, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/models/companies.js` file underwent minor corrections. The only substantive change was adding the `type: String` definition to the `country` field within the `companiesSchema`.

Finally, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/users.js` file was updated three times between 13:35:00 and 13:35:17 on 09/05/2025.  These changes seem to involve minor adjustments or corrections to a JSON array representing employee data, possibly related to formatting or content.  The content itself appears to be a large JSON array of employee overtime details.  No significant structural changes are apparent.


## 15:00:35
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/users.js` file was updated on 09/05/2025 at 14:14:12.  The update consists of a JSON array containing overtime payment records for various employees.  Each object in the array represents an employee's overtime payment for February 2025 (`pay_month: "2025-02"`), specifying their employee ID (`emp_id`), name (`user_full_name`), country (`country`), overtime category (e.g., "Overtime," "Over Time Travel," "Over Time Holiday", "Overtime A (Fra_Emp)", "Overtime B (Fra_Emp)", "Overtime C (Fra_Emp)"), overtime hours worked (`overtime_hours`), the corresponding overtime amount (`overtime_amount`), their old basic salary (`old_basic_salary`), and a boolean indicating if their salary was adjusted (`isSalaryAdjusted`).

The data shows overtime payments for multiple employees across different countries (UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia).  A significant number of employees have multiple overtime entries, reflecting various overtime categories.  Some employees have a `old_basic_salary` of 0, while others have non-zero values.  The `isSalaryAdjusted` field indicates whether the employee's salary was adjusted based on their overtime.  There's a pattern of several employees having entries across different overtime categories ("Overtime", "Over Time Travel", "Over Time Holiday").  Finally, employee 573 has three different overtime categories labeled A, B, and C.


## 17:00:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/payrollprocess.js` on September 5th, 2025.  The `/server.js` file shows no significant code changes between the two recorded timestamps; it appears to be a large express.js server setup with numerous API endpoints and cron jobs.


The `/api/payrollprocess.js` file, however, undergoes several revisions between 16:31:50 and 16:59:01. These revisions do not appear to alter the core functionality of the file.  All changes are minor and consist of consistent reformatting and no changes in the code logic.  The file defines various API routes related to payroll processes, including:

*   `/approvalDetails`: A POST endpoint to get approval details.
*   Routes for retrieving all, active, and filtered payroll processes based on company ID and country.  Many of these endpoints offer the option to retrieve only key fields (`/all/keys/...`).
*   Endpoints to get company data and data related to specific users or processes.

The file uses various libraries including `express`, `mongoose`, `AWS`, `sendgrid`, and `moment-timezone` suggesting a backend service managing payroll processing, user approvals, and potentially notification systems integrated with AWS and SendGrid.  The repeated structure of the try-catch blocks in each route handling suggests a consistent pattern of error handling.


## 18:00:36
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/payrollprocess.js` file underwent multiple revisions on September 5th, 2025, between 17:03 and 17:17.  The code consistently defines an Express.js API for managing payroll processes.  No functional changes are observed across the revisions; only timestamps are different. The API uses various models (`PayrollProcessModel`, `UsersModel`, `CompanyModel`, etc.) for database interactions and utilizes middleware for access token validation (`validateToken`).  Multiple routes are defined to handle various requests, including fetching all payroll processes, filtering by status ("active" or "inactive"), company ID, and country. Some routes provide a subset of fields using `.select()`. One route uses aggregation (`aggregate()`) to join data from the "users" collection.  The code also interacts with SendGrid for email sending and AWS SES, although specific credentials are obscured.  There are no noticeable patterns beyond the consistent use of `PayrollProcessModel` and similar error handling in each route.
