# Activity Summary for 09/05/2025

## 11:07:29
On September 5th, 2025, at 10:39:05, the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/app.js` file was updated.  The changes primarily involved configuring an Express.js application.  The update included setting up middleware for security (Helmet), CORS, request timeouts, file uploads (with size limits), JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, and data sanitization (XSS, though mongoSanitize was disabled).  It also integrated  JWT authentication using Passport.js,  applied compression, and configured custom error handling.  The application uses Morgan for logging (though conditionally, based on environment).  A custom middleware adds several security-related HTTP headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.). The routes are defined in a separate `./routes` module.  The application includes a welcome message at the `/v1` endpoint and handles 404 errors.  Rate limiting for authentication endpoints was included in the code but commented out.  A commented-out section suggests there was a placeholder for employee data (likely to be added later).
