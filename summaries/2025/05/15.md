## 10:44:18
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js`  between 10:01:37 and 10:08:39 on May 15, 2025.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` was updated once at 09:45:08 on May 15, 2025. This update involved setting up an Express.js application with various middleware including `helmet`, `cors`, `passport`, `mongoSanitize`, and `compression`.  It also includes routes setup, error handling, and scheduling of cron jobs (`scheduleUserChecks`, `updateOrgChart`).


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` file underwent several rapid updates within a short timeframe (10:01:37 to 10:02:53). These updates primarily focused on the `computePayroll` function, suggesting iterative development and debugging of this particular function. The code is involved in payroll calculation, taking into account overtime hours, holidays, weekends, and company-specific configurations. The multiple revisions likely reflect the complexity of this payroll calculation and adjustments made during development.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js` file was updated three times between 10:08:06 and 10:08:39.  These changes added several functions related to payroll processing, including fetching, updating, and approving pay items. Notably,  the code includes functions for email notifications using AWS SES and database interactions (using `Payitems`, `PayrollProcess`, `User`, `Companies`, and `Notification` models). The `approvePayItems` function suggests a workflow for approving payroll items.  The close timestamps indicate a focused period of development or refactoring within this service.


## 11:44:19
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` on May 15, 2025.  The file is an Express.js API route handler for payroll processing.  No substantive changes are apparent in the code across all revisions; the primary change is the addition of  `const { Payroll } = require("@nathangroup/payroll");` at approximately 11:08:13. This suggests the integration of a third-party payroll library. The code consistently handles various GET requests to retrieve payroll data filtered by pay month, user ID, status (active/inactive), and other criteria.  POST requests handle adding new payroll items and submitting salary sheets for approval, including email notifications. A PUT request updates existing payroll items.  The `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` POST routes are substantial, managing the workflow for salary sheet submission and approval, logging actions, sending emails, and creating notifications.  The timestamps show frequent, minor edits possibly related to debugging or minor code refinements, but the core functionality remains the same throughout the period observed.


## 12:44:23
The provided log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` throughout May 15, 2025, between 11:47 AM and 12:23 PM.  The code remains largely unchanged across these updates; the modifications appear to be minor and likely related to debugging or very small refinements.  No substantial functional changes are apparent in the code itself.  The file defines various API routes for managing payroll processes, including GET requests for retrieving data (all processes, processes by pay month, active processes, etc.), PUT requests for updating existing processes, and POST requests for adding new processes and submitting them for approval.  The `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` routes handle the workflow of payroll approvals, including notification and email functionalities. The code uses several models (`PayrollProcessModel`, `UsersModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `NotificationsModel`, etc.) for database interactions. There is use of `moment.js` for date manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending. AWS SES is also used for sending emails.  The code includes error handling within try-catch blocks.  The changes all occur within a very short timeframe suggesting iterative development or debugging sessions.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/server.js` file was also updated twice on the same day at 12:24 PM and 12:25 PM  with no significant code changes.  This file sets up the main Express.js server, connecting to a MongoDB database, configuring middleware (cors, body-parser, fileUpload, helmet), defining API routes for various modules, scheduling cron jobs, and setting up a Socket.IO server for real-time communication.


## 15:06:50
The provided log shows three edits to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file within a short timeframe (15/05/2025, between 14:01:49 and 14:04:02).  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, likely bug fixes or small UI adjustments.  There are no substantial structural or functional alterations across the revisions. The code consistently displays a Vue.js component dealing with payroll processes, featuring buttons for approval, rejection, submission for approval, and closing of payroll sheets.  The component also includes dialogs for confirmation, displays approver information, and shows a summary dashboard.  No discernible pattern emerges beyond incremental modifications within the existing code structure.


## 16:06:53
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/recursive.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 15/05/2025, 15:42:49 and 15:47:49.  The core functionality remained consistent throughoutâ€”handling various HTTP requests related to recursive models, likely representing recurring payroll items.  These requests include retrieving all items, items by user, active items for a specific user and pay month, pending items, and active items, along with  updating and adding new items.  Each request uses the `validateToken` middleware, suggesting authentication is required.

The most significant changes occurred within the `router.post("/approveRecursiveRequests", ...)` function.  Specifically, the conditional logic concerning `updateRecursive.include_current_pay_month` was modified several times between 15:42:57 and 15:47:49.  Initially, it checked `!(updateRecursive.hasOwnProperty('include_current_pay_month')) || updateRecursive.include_current_pay_month == false`. This was later changed to `(updateRecursive.hasOwnProperty('include_current_pay_month') || updateRecursive.include_current_pay_month == false)`, then further refined to `(updateRecursive.hasOwnProperty('include_current_pay_month') || updateRecursive.include_current_pay_month == true)` and finally to `(updateRecursive.hasOwnProperty('include_current_pay_month') && updateRecursive.include_current_pay_month == true)`. This evolution shows a refinement of how the code handles the inclusion of current pay month in the payroll processing.


The code interacts with several models: `RecursiveModel`, `PayrollProcessModel`, `UsersModel`, `ConfigModel`, and `PayrollModel`, indicating a complex system managing user requests, approvals, and payroll data.  An email notification system using SendGrid is implemented for approval requests, sending notifications to 'robert.toernqvist@inter.ikea.com' and 'basil@nathanhr.com'. The AWS SDK is included, although commented-out access keys suggest alternative configuration methods are used.  Overall, the changes reflect iterative debugging and refinement of the approval process and payroll item creation within a recurring payroll system.


## 17:12:51
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` on May 15, 2025, between 16:18:55 and 16:22:51.  No functional changes are apparent across these revisions; the code remains identical.  The file is a Vue component responsible for adding new pay items, offering both single and bulk upload functionalities. It uses Vuetify components extensively for UI elements like dialogs, forms, input fields, and data display.  The component handles various pay item types (earnings, deductions), recurring pay items, and different input fields depending on the selected item type (e.g., number of days for unpaid leave, hours for overtime).  A bulk upload feature allows processing CSV files.  There is a download option for a template file (`/template/payitems.xlsx`).

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file was updated once at 16:21:11 on May 15, 2025. This file appears to be a Vue page for managing a specific payroll entry (`_id` suggests a dynamic route parameter).  It includes features for approving/rejecting payroll entries, submitting for approval, viewing approval history, closing the payroll sheet, and generating payslips. The page also uses components like `AddNewPayitem`, `DashboardSS`, and `DataTable`  and displays payroll statistics.  Email functionality to send notifications to managers is also implemented.
