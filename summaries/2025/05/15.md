# Activity Summary for 15/05/2025

## 10:44:18
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js`  between 10:01:37 and 10:08:39 on May 15, 2025.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` was updated once at 09:45:08 on May 15, 2025. This update involved setting up an Express.js application with various middleware including `helmet`, `cors`, `passport`, `mongoSanitize`, and `compression`.  It also includes routes setup, error handling, and scheduling of cron jobs (`scheduleUserChecks`, `updateOrgChart`).


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` file underwent several rapid updates within a short timeframe (10:01:37 to 10:02:53). These updates primarily focused on the `computePayroll` function, suggesting iterative development and debugging of this particular function. The code is involved in payroll calculation, taking into account overtime hours, holidays, weekends, and company-specific configurations. The multiple revisions likely reflect the complexity of this payroll calculation and adjustments made during development.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js` file was updated three times between 10:08:06 and 10:08:39.  These changes added several functions related to payroll processing, including fetching, updating, and approving pay items. Notably,  the code includes functions for email notifications using AWS SES and database interactions (using `Payitems`, `PayrollProcess`, `User`, `Companies`, and `Notification` models). The `approvePayItems` function suggests a workflow for approving payroll items.  The close timestamps indicate a focused period of development or refactoring within this service.


## 11:44:19
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` on May 15, 2025.  The file is an Express.js API route handler for payroll processing.  No substantive changes are apparent in the code across all revisions; the primary change is the addition of  `const { Payroll } = require("@nathangroup/payroll");` at approximately 11:08:13. This suggests the integration of a third-party payroll library. The code consistently handles various GET requests to retrieve payroll data filtered by pay month, user ID, status (active/inactive), and other criteria.  POST requests handle adding new payroll items and submitting salary sheets for approval, including email notifications. A PUT request updates existing payroll items.  The `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` POST routes are substantial, managing the workflow for salary sheet submission and approval, logging actions, sending emails, and creating notifications.  The timestamps show frequent, minor edits possibly related to debugging or minor code refinements, but the core functionality remains the same throughout the period observed.


## 12:44:23
The provided log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/api/payrollprocess.js` throughout May 15, 2025, between 11:47 AM and 12:23 PM.  The code remains largely unchanged across these updates; the modifications appear to be minor and likely related to debugging or very small refinements.  No substantial functional changes are apparent in the code itself.  The file defines various API routes for managing payroll processes, including GET requests for retrieving data (all processes, processes by pay month, active processes, etc.), PUT requests for updating existing processes, and POST requests for adding new processes and submitting them for approval.  The `submitForApproval` and `approveSalarySheet` routes handle the workflow of payroll approvals, including notification and email functionalities. The code uses several models (`PayrollProcessModel`, `UsersModel`, `ConfigurationModel`, `NotificationsModel`, etc.) for database interactions. There is use of `moment.js` for date manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending. AWS SES is also used for sending emails.  The code includes error handling within try-catch blocks.  The changes all occur within a very short timeframe suggesting iterative development or debugging sessions.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/ikea-api/server.js` file was also updated twice on the same day at 12:24 PM and 12:25 PM  with no significant code changes.  This file sets up the main Express.js server, connecting to a MongoDB database, configuring middleware (cors, body-parser, fileUpload, helmet), defining API routes for various modules, scheduling cron jobs, and setting up a Socket.IO server for real-time communication.
