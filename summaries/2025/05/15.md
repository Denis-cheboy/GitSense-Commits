The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js`  between 10:01:37 and 10:08:39 on May 15, 2025.


`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` was updated once at 09:45:08 on May 15, 2025. This update involved setting up an Express.js application with various middleware including `helmet`, `cors`, `passport`, `mongoSanitize`, and `compression`.  It also includes routes setup, error handling, and scheduling of cron jobs (`scheduleUserChecks`, `updateOrgChart`).


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/overtime.service.js` file underwent several rapid updates within a short timeframe (10:01:37 to 10:02:53). These updates primarily focused on the `computePayroll` function, suggesting iterative development and debugging of this particular function. The code is involved in payroll calculation, taking into account overtime hours, holidays, weekends, and company-specific configurations. The multiple revisions likely reflect the complexity of this payroll calculation and adjustments made during development.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/payroll.service.js` file was updated three times between 10:08:06 and 10:08:39.  These changes added several functions related to payroll processing, including fetching, updating, and approving pay items. Notably,  the code includes functions for email notifications using AWS SES and database interactions (using `Payitems`, `PayrollProcess`, `User`, `Companies`, and `Notification` models). The `approvePayItems` function suggests a workflow for approving payroll items.  The close timestamps indicate a focused period of development or refactoring within this service.
