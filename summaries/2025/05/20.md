# Activity Summary for 20/05/2025

## 11:51:10
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file on May 20, 2025.  The code defines API routes for managing salary adjustments.  There are no functional changes between the revisions. All revisions contain the same code.  The timestamps indicate that multiple saves happened within a short time frame (11:03:37, 11:25:22, 11:25:45, 11:25:56). This suggests potential autosaves or rapid iterative development.

The `/salaryAdjustment.js` file implements various HTTP methods (GET and POST) to handle different aspects of salary adjustments:

* **Fetching data:**  It includes routes to get all salary adjustments (`/all`), adjustments for a specific user (`/user/:user_id`), pending adjustments for a user (`/pending/:_id`), adjustments for a given pay month and company (`/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`), the latest adjustment for a user (`/get_latest/:id`), and counts of active, pending, and withdrawn adjustments (`/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month`).

* **Adding data:**  There are endpoints for adding a single salary adjustment (`/add-item`) and multiple adjustments at once (`/add-item-many`). The `/add-item-many` route interacts with a `configurationModel` to determine approvers and sets their initial approval statuses.  A commented-out section suggests planned notification functionality.

* **Updating and counting data:** An endpoint exists for updating existing salary adjustments (`/:_id`).  There are also endpoints to retrieve all requests (`/get_all_requests`, `/get_all_requests/:createdBy`) and their respective counts (`/get_all_requests_count`, `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`), differentiating between pending and completed adjustments based on a `history` parameter.


A recurring pattern is the use of `validateToken` middleware for authentication on all routes.  Error handling using `try...catch` blocks is consistently implemented. The code uses `moment-timezone` for date manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending (though no email sending actually takes place in the visible code).  The code heavily utilizes MongoDB's Mongoose ODM for database interaction (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`, `configurationModel`, etc.).  The prorating calculation logic is a significant part of the `/add-item` and `/add-item-many` routes, calculating the daily amount based on the difference between old and new salaries.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file underwent multiple revisions on May 20, 2025.  The changes appear to primarily focus on adding and retrieving salary adjustment data.  There are no discernible changes to the core structure or logic of the existing API endpoints between the different timestamps.


The file consistently uses the `SalaryAdjustmentModel` for database interactions, indicating that all operations revolve around managing salary adjustment records.  Several endpoints handle different aspects of these records:

* `/all`: Retrieves all salary adjustment records.
* `/add-item`: Adds a single salary adjustment item.  This endpoint calculates a prorated amount based on the effective date and differences between old and new salaries.
* `/add-item-many`: Adds multiple salary adjustment items at once, similarly calculating prorated amounts and including a basic approval workflow (though the actual approval logic is commented out).
* `/user/:user_id`: Retrieves salary adjustment records for a specific user.
* `/:_id`: Updates an existing salary adjustment record.
* `/pending/:_id`: Counts pending salary adjustment requests for a user.
* `/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`: Retrieves salary adjustments for a specific company and pay month.
* `/get_latest/:id`: Retrieves the latest salary adjustment for a specific user.
* `/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month`: Counts salary adjustments (active, pending, withdrawn) for a given company and pay month.
* `/get_all_requests`: Retrieves all pending or completed salary adjustment requests based on a `history` flag.
* `/get_all_requests/:createdBy`: Retrieves pending or completed requests either created by a specific user or assigned for their approval.
* `/get_all_requests_count`: Counts pending or completed salary adjustment requests, also based on a `history` flag.
* `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`: Counts pending or completed requests created by or assigned to a user.


The timestamps show a flurry of edits between 12:23 and 12:38, suggesting rapid iterative development or debugging.  A final significant change occurs at 12:44.  The commented-out notification section in the `/add-item-many` route suggests a planned future feature to send notifications upon new salary adjustment requests.  The code uses `moment-timezone` for date and time manipulation.  Error handling is consistently implemented using try-catch blocks.


## 13:51:11
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/server.js` on May 20, 2025.  The `salaryAdjustment.js` file underwent several revisions within a short timeframe (12:52:41 to 12:57:36), suggesting iterative development or bug fixing. These changes primarily involved adding or modifying API endpoints related to salary adjustments.  The endpoints handle GET and POST requests for retrieving, adding (single and multiple), updating, and counting salary adjustment records, filtering by user ID, company ID, pay month, and status ("active", "pending", "withdrawn").  A significant portion of the code focuses on calculating prorated salary adjustments based on the effective date and differences between old and new salaries.  A commented-out section hints at planned notification functionality.

The `server.js` file was updated several times between 13:18:22 and 13:37:17. These changes involved adding various API routes for different functionalities, indicating expansion of the application's features.  Numerous API routes are added to handle requests related to loans, passports, claims, letters, pages, locations, news, comments, clients, reports, social stories, sessions, employees, companies, roles, users, processes, requests, ticketing, logging, documents, settings, leaves, employees, tasks, projects, bookings, attendance, surveys, configurations, stories, to-do lists, socials, shifts, payslips, payroll, EOS, payroll processes, chats, history, performance, onboarding, offboarding, stages, letter templates, forms, forums, offer letters and notification templates.  The code utilizes various libraries for database interaction (mongoose), middleware (cors, body-parser, fileUpload, timeout, helmet, morgan), email sending (SendGrid), and cron jobs for scheduled tasks.  The consistent use of `validateToken` middleware suggests authentication is enforced across most endpoints.


## 15:13:58
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file underwent multiple revisions on May 20, 2025.  The changes primarily involved the addition and refinement of API routes related to salary adjustments.

The code consistently uses the `SalaryAdjustmentModel` for database interactions, indicating a focus on managing salary adjustment records.  Multiple routes (`/all`, `/user/:user_id`, `/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`, `/get_latest/:id`, `/pending/:_id`, `/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month`) handle retrieval of salary adjustment data with varying filtering options (e.g., by user ID, company ID, pay month, status).  The `/add-item` and `/add-item-many` routes handle creation of new adjustment records, including a calculation for prorating based on the effective date. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling requests related to getting all requests and the count of pending and processed requests.  There's also a commented-out section in the `add-item-many` route that suggests an intended feature for sending notifications upon salary adjustment request submission, which is not yet implemented.  The updates between timestamps show no substantial code changes, suggesting minor refinements or bug fixes rather than major feature additions.  The final revision at 14:31:04 appears to be the same as previous revisions.
