# Activity Summary for 20/05/2025

## 11:51:10
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/salaryAdjustment.js` file on May 20, 2025.  The code defines API routes for managing salary adjustments.  There are no functional changes between the revisions. All revisions contain the same code.  The timestamps indicate that multiple saves happened within a short time frame (11:03:37, 11:25:22, 11:25:45, 11:25:56). This suggests potential autosaves or rapid iterative development.

The `/salaryAdjustment.js` file implements various HTTP methods (GET and POST) to handle different aspects of salary adjustments:

* **Fetching data:**  It includes routes to get all salary adjustments (`/all`), adjustments for a specific user (`/user/:user_id`), pending adjustments for a user (`/pending/:_id`), adjustments for a given pay month and company (`/pay_month/:company_id/:pay_month`), the latest adjustment for a user (`/get_latest/:id`), and counts of active, pending, and withdrawn adjustments (`/pay_month/count/:company_id/:pay_month`).

* **Adding data:**  There are endpoints for adding a single salary adjustment (`/add-item`) and multiple adjustments at once (`/add-item-many`). The `/add-item-many` route interacts with a `configurationModel` to determine approvers and sets their initial approval statuses.  A commented-out section suggests planned notification functionality.

* **Updating and counting data:** An endpoint exists for updating existing salary adjustments (`/:_id`).  There are also endpoints to retrieve all requests (`/get_all_requests`, `/get_all_requests/:createdBy`) and their respective counts (`/get_all_requests_count`, `/get_all_requests_count/:createdBy`), differentiating between pending and completed adjustments based on a `history` parameter.


A recurring pattern is the use of `validateToken` middleware for authentication on all routes.  Error handling using `try...catch` blocks is consistently implemented. The code uses `moment-timezone` for date manipulation and `@sendgrid/mail` for email sending (though no email sending actually takes place in the visible code).  The code heavily utilizes MongoDB's Mongoose ODM for database interaction (`SalaryAdjustmentModel`, `configurationModel`, etc.).  The prorating calculation logic is a significant part of the `/add-item` and `/add-item-many` routes, calculating the daily amount based on the difference between old and new salaries.
