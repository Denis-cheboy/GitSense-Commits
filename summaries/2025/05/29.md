# Activity Summary for 29/05/2025

## 11:05:35
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file was updated on 29/05/2025 at 10:13:29.  The update involved changes to the `scripts` section, adding various commands for development (`dev`, `devMac`), staging (`staging`, `companyConfig`, `build-staging`, `start-staging`), production (`production`, `build`, `start`), and other tasks like building (`build-companyConfig`, `generate`) and starting the application in different environments.  All script commands appear to use `webpack` for building and `nodemon` for running the server, with environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `BUILD`) controlling the execution context.  The `dependencies` section shows a large number of packages, suggesting a complex application with features including calendar integration (@fullcalendar/*), charting (apexcharts, vue-chartjs, hchs-vue-charts), form handling (@braid/vue-formulate),  internationalization (@nuxtjs/i18n), UI components (vuetify, @syncfusion/*, @ssthouse/vue-tree-chart), and various other utilities.  The use of `@nathangroup/*` packages suggests internal company libraries for attendance, leave management, letters, payroll, and work from home functionalities. The `devDependencies` section lists tools for development and build processes.  The application uses Nuxt.js framework.
