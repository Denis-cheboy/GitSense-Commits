# Activity Summary for 29/05/2025

## 11:05:35
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file was updated on 29/05/2025 at 10:13:29.  The update involved changes to the `scripts` section, adding various commands for development (`dev`, `devMac`), staging (`staging`, `companyConfig`, `build-staging`, `start-staging`), production (`production`, `build`, `start`), and other tasks like building (`build-companyConfig`, `generate`) and starting the application in different environments.  All script commands appear to use `webpack` for building and `nodemon` for running the server, with environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `BUILD`) controlling the execution context.  The `dependencies` section shows a large number of packages, suggesting a complex application with features including calendar integration (@fullcalendar/*), charting (apexcharts, vue-chartjs, hchs-vue-charts), form handling (@braid/vue-formulate),  internationalization (@nuxtjs/i18n), UI components (vuetify, @syncfusion/*, @ssthouse/vue-tree-chart), and various other utilities.  The use of `@nathangroup/*` packages suggests internal company libraries for attendance, leave management, letters, payroll, and work from home functionalities. The `devDependencies` section lists tools for development and build processes.  The application uses Nuxt.js framework.

The log shows several code changes made to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin` project on May 29, 2025.

The most significant changes involved `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`. This file, a Vue component, underwent multiple updates between 11:29:53 and 11:38:21, all appearing to be minor adjustments or refinements within the same section of code. These edits focused on the display and interaction elements of a payroll process summary, including  buttons for generating supplementary payroll,  handling approvals, and downloading various bank files (SIF for UAE, KSA, and QAR). The  repeated code structure suggests iterative refinement rather than fundamental restructuring.

A separate and substantial change occurred at 11:55:03 and 11:55:41 in `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`.  This Vue component, responsible for displaying a salary sheet data table, was modified.  The update added a search bar and a download button for exporting the data to an excel sheet.  The table dynamically generates columns based on the `config` prop (likely containing payroll configuration data), showing earnings, deductions and totals.  The added feature highlights salary adjustments with a red information icon.  The two edits at this timestamp are almost identical.  There's a high likelihood that the second edit either corrected a minor error or was a redundant commit.


Finally, a change was made at 11:38:11 to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file. This file, containing project dependencies and scripts, was updated. The update likely involves adding or updating  various libraries and tools used in the project (such as Vue components, charting libraries, and others). The presence of different scripts for `dev`, `staging`, `companyConfig`, and `production` environments points to a robust build and deployment process.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file was updated on 29/05/2025, 12:16:19.  The update significantly alters the display and interactive elements of a payroll processing section.  The changes center around a Vue.js component rendering a data table of payroll processes.  This table displays information such as creation date, type (Monthly/Supplementary), status (active/inactive), and employee type.  Crucially, the update adds numerous interactive elements within each row:

* **Add New Pay Item:** Buttons to add new pay items for both monthly and supplementary cycles, conditionally rendered based on the payroll process status and user role.
* **Approval Actions:**  Buttons and tooltips for submitting payroll runs for approval, viewing pending approval requests, approving, and rejecting submissions.  These actions are also conditionally displayed based on status and type.
* **Withhold Salary:** A button to trigger a dialog for withholding employee salaries, available only for active monthly payroll runs that haven't been submitted for approval.
* **Download Bank Files:** Buttons to download bank files (SIF for UAE, KSA and QAR bank files), conditionally rendered based on currency and configuration settings.  The file types downloaded depend on the payroll run status.
* **Download GL Report:** A button to download a general ledger report in XLSX format.

The code uses Vue.js components (`v-data-table`, `v-btn`, `v-tooltip`, `v-img`, `v-chip`, etc.) extensively.  The conditional rendering heavily relies on the `item.status`, `item.type`, `item.submit_for_approval`, `isAdminRole`, and configuration settings to control the visibility of different buttons and actions within the table.  The  `payrollprocesses` array is used to access data for display and functional purposes.  There is also use of custom filters like `paymonthDateFormatter` and `payrollPayprocess` suggesting custom data formatting within the application.
