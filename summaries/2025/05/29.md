# Activity Summary for 29/05/2025

## 11:05:35
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file was updated on 29/05/2025 at 10:13:29.  The update involved changes to the `scripts` section, adding various commands for development (`dev`, `devMac`), staging (`staging`, `companyConfig`, `build-staging`, `start-staging`), production (`production`, `build`, `start`), and other tasks like building (`build-companyConfig`, `generate`) and starting the application in different environments.  All script commands appear to use `webpack` for building and `nodemon` for running the server, with environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `BUILD`) controlling the execution context.  The `dependencies` section shows a large number of packages, suggesting a complex application with features including calendar integration (@fullcalendar/*), charting (apexcharts, vue-chartjs, hchs-vue-charts), form handling (@braid/vue-formulate),  internationalization (@nuxtjs/i18n), UI components (vuetify, @syncfusion/*, @ssthouse/vue-tree-chart), and various other utilities.  The use of `@nathangroup/*` packages suggests internal company libraries for attendance, leave management, letters, payroll, and work from home functionalities. The `devDependencies` section lists tools for development and build processes.  The application uses Nuxt.js framework.

The log shows several code changes made to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin` project on May 29, 2025.

The most significant changes involved `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`. This file, a Vue component, underwent multiple updates between 11:29:53 and 11:38:21, all appearing to be minor adjustments or refinements within the same section of code. These edits focused on the display and interaction elements of a payroll process summary, including  buttons for generating supplementary payroll,  handling approvals, and downloading various bank files (SIF for UAE, KSA, and QAR). The  repeated code structure suggests iterative refinement rather than fundamental restructuring.

A separate and substantial change occurred at 11:55:03 and 11:55:41 in `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`.  This Vue component, responsible for displaying a salary sheet data table, was modified.  The update added a search bar and a download button for exporting the data to an excel sheet.  The table dynamically generates columns based on the `config` prop (likely containing payroll configuration data), showing earnings, deductions and totals.  The added feature highlights salary adjustments with a red information icon.  The two edits at this timestamp are almost identical.  There's a high likelihood that the second edit either corrected a minor error or was a redundant commit.


Finally, a change was made at 11:38:11 to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-admin/package.json` file. This file, containing project dependencies and scripts, was updated. The update likely involves adding or updating  various libraries and tools used in the project (such as Vue components, charting libraries, and others). The presence of different scripts for `dev`, `staging`, `companyConfig`, and `production` environments points to a robust build and deployment process.
