# Activity Summary for 28/05/2025

## 10:12:53
The log shows several code changes on May 28, 2025, focusing on a Vue.js application.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/pages/index.vue` file was updated at 09:12:51.  This update significantly revised the login page UI. Changes include adding an Outlook login option, implementing OTP verification, a create-new-password flow, and a forgot-password functionality.  The code uses Vuetify components extensively for styling and form elements.  Error handling with `v-alert` components is implemented for various scenarios (authentication failures, incorrect OTP, password mismatch).  The visual design incorporates images, customized styling, and responsive layout adjustments using Vuetify's `v-col` and `v-row` components.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/store/index.js` file was updated at 09:41:41. This update modified the Vuex store, primarily adding and adjusting functionalities related to user authentication, session management, and data persistence using `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies.  The store manages user roles (isAdmin, isSalAcc, etc.), token handling, and user profile information.  Encryption using CryptoJS is present in some areas (although the specifics of what data is being encrypted isn't entirely clear due to commented-out sections).  Several mutations are added to manage various aspects of user data and session status. Actions are included to handle user login, logout, session initialization (`nuxtServerInit`), and data persistence via `localStorage` and cookies, including setting user roles.  A notable feature is the handling of different user roles with corresponding cookie flags. Cookie values are parsed and used to populate Vuex state.  The  `setLang` mutation appears to always set the language to 'en' regardless of the input, which is inconsistent with the intended logic.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/nuxt.config.js` file was updated twice, at 09:43:02 and 09:43:12, with minimal differences between the two commits.  These updates configure the Nuxt.js application.  They specify various plugins (including Vuetify, Axios, authentication, i18n), define CSP (Content Security Policy) settings for enhanced security, and configure the Axios base URL and other settings based on environment variables pulled from a `config` file. The build configuration utilizes a webpack plugin to provide Lodash and Quill.js globally. The application uses a refresh token strategy for authentication. There's also a setup for internationalization using `@nuxtjs/i18n`.  The Helmet module adds several security headers to enhance HTTP security.


## 10:13:03
The log shows multiple updates to the `.env` file between 09:15:49 and 10:03:44 on May 28, 2025.  The primary change involves the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Initially, it contains commented-out options for different database connections (MongoDB).  The changes cycle through uncommenting different connection strings,  finally settling on  `DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://survitec-admin:aVJDGCXtV7ZLGaMi@clustera.lolh0.mongodb.net/survitec-prod` at 10:03:44.  Other environment variables remain largely consistent, indicating configuration for email services (SendGrid), authentication (JWT), AWS, and various API URLs.  There is no change in the values of the other environment variables throughout the log.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/helper/attendance_update_watcher.js` file at 09:19:34 contains code for monitoring attendance updates, updating remarks in the database, and sending late notification emails using AWS SES.  The code is extensively commented out, suggesting it might be under development or temporarily disabled.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/helper/user_update_watch.js` file at 09:19:48 includes code to monitor user and configuration updates, encrypting data using CryptoJS and storing it in Redis.  Again, much of this code is commented out.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/server.js` file at 09:20:00 shows a Node.js application using Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB), SendGrid, Socket.IO, and various other packages. It defines numerous API routes for different functionalities (loans, passports, claims, letters, etc.) and includes scheduled tasks (using `node-cron`) for various processes like events, quotes, expired documents, and client reports.  The file also imports the `user_update_watch` and `attendance_update_watcher` helper modules, suggesting integration with real-time data updates.


## 11:38:17
The provided log shows three revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/api/payrollprocess.js` file, all within a short time frame on May 28th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and likely involve bug fixes or small adjustments rather than substantial feature additions.  All three revisions contain identical code, suggesting that the timestamps may be slightly inaccurate or that the change tracking tool only registered the file as modified without reflecting actual code alterations.  The file is an Express.js API endpoint handler for payroll processing, making extensive use of Mongoose for database interactions (PayrollProcessModel, UsersModel, payrollConfigModel etc).  It handles various GET and POST requests to retrieve and manipulate payroll data, often filtered by company ID and status ("active" or "inactive").  Several routes focus on retrieving specific fields (`select` method) from the `PayrollProcessModel`.  The code utilizes SendGrid for email, AWS SES for likely email sending related functionality and axios for HTTP client requests.  There is no discernible pattern in the changes between the timestamps except the file being marked as modified.


## 11:38:18
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file was updated on 28/05/2025, 10:24:51.  The update significantly alters the UI for payroll processing, adding features for approval, rejection, and closing of payroll sheets.

Key changes include:

* **Approval Workflow:**  The component now incorporates a comprehensive approval workflow.  Users can approve or reject payroll sheets, view approver details (name, status, date, comments), and see the approval status at each level.  A dialog confirms submission for approval.

* **Sheet Closing:**  A functionality to close payroll sheets and generate payslips is implemented, with a confirmation dialog and success message. This action is seemingly restricted to a specific user (`user._id=='60e03ef5a52790ddeab89cc5'`).

* **SIF Report Download:** A button allows downloading a SIF report, contingent on the sheet's active status and a computed flag (`computedShowSIF`).

* **Company Selection:** An autocomplete dropdown allows selection of a company, triggering a `handleChangeSalarySheet()` function.  This suggests dynamic loading of salary data based on the selected company.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI is extensively redesigned using Vue.js components (v-card, v-row, v-col, v-btn, v-dialog, v-autocomplete, v-avatar, etc.) to create a cleaner and more interactive experience.  The display of payroll status (Open/Closed) is improved.

* **Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of `v-if` and `v-else` directives conditionally renders elements based on various factors (approval status, sheet status, user roles, data availability).


The code shows a clear separation of concerns with the use of several components such as `ApprovalDialog`, `AddNewPayitem`, and `DashboardSS`.  The styling heavily relies on Vuetify's styling system.  Error handling and success messages are displayed using `v-alert` components.  The data handling seems to rely on fetching data from a backend service, evidenced by functions like `services_general.getUserName()`. There's also a use of date formatting (`formatDate` and `paymonthDateFormatter` filters) and number formatting (`thousandSeparator` filter).


## 13:23:21
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` file underwent two revisions on May 28th, 2025.  The first revision (12:29:39) introduced numerous asynchronous functions related to payroll processing. These functions interact with various models (`PayrollProcess`, `Requests`, `User`, `Configuration`, `PayrollConfig`, `Companies`, etc.) using Mongoose and perform operations like retrieving, filtering, and aggregating payroll data.  The code also utilizes external libraries such as `moment`, `lodash`, `crypto-js`, `aws-sdk`, and a custom `email_helper`. A `closeSalarySheet` function is also defined.

The second revision (12:30:00) added further functionality to the `getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity` function. This addition calculates gratuity, incorporating last month's payroll data to aid in the calculation. The function now includes fetching data for last month's payroll using `PayrollProcess.find` and iterates through user data to update department and designation names based on matching IDs found in `coreConfigs`.  The core difference between the revisions is the addition of last month's payroll data fetching and processing within the `getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity` function in the second revision.  Both revisions heavily use asynchronous operations and database interactions.


## 14:23:31
The log shows numerous edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` on May 28, 2025.  The edits appear to be iterative refinements to a payroll processing service.  The code consists primarily of asynchronous functions (`async` keyword heavily used) interacting with a MongoDB database (using Mongoose and aggregate functions) and possibly an AWS SES service for email (based on the `AWS.SES` instantiation).

The modifications span a timeframe of approximately 22 minutes (13:33:16 to 13:55:56).  No substantial structural changes are evident across the edits; instead, the changes consist mostly of minor additions or adjustments within existing functions.   A recurring pattern involves querying and manipulating data from collections like `PayrollProcess`, `Payroll`, `User`, `PayrollConfig`, and `Companies`. The functions often incorporate data aggregation, filtering, and projection using MongoDB's aggregation framework.  Several functions (`getConfiguration`, `getPayrollProcessActiveByCompanyIdService`, `getPayrollProcessActiveByConfigIdService`) seem redundant in their functionality, fetching similar data from `Configuration` and `PayrollConfig` collections. The `getCardsValue` function appears to process payroll data to calculate summary statistics (total fixed salary, additions, deductions, total salary).  The `getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity` function is a complex function involving multiple database queries and calculations related to gratuity.  There's also usage of the `@nathangroup/payroll` package for variance computation.  Overall, the changes suggest ongoing development and debugging of a payroll calculation and reporting service.


## 15:48:05
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/wilhelmsen-mcs-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` file between 14:36:43 and 14:54:09 on May 28, 2025.  The file contains numerous asynchronous JavaScript functions related to payroll processing.  No changes to the code itself are observable across the multiple revisions.  The timestamps indicate frequent, minor commits, suggesting iterative development or debugging.  The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interactions (e.g., `PayrollProcess.find()`, `PayrollConfig.findOne()`, `User.aggregate()`), indicating a MongoDB backend.  It also leverages the `@nathangroup/payroll` package for payroll calculations and AWS SES for email functionality.  Functions are predominantly focused on retrieving payroll data based on various filters (company ID, status, pay month) and performing calculations like variance and gratuity computations. The `getCardsValue` function calculates summary statistics from payroll data.  The code uses `moment.js` for date manipulation.


## 17:10:52
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/arise-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` between 16:54:47 and 16:59:11 on May 28, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, with no substantial structural alterations to the component's code.  The component is a Vue.js component for adding pay items, offering both single and bulk upload functionalities.  The single upload section includes extensive form elements for specifying employee names, pay months, recurring types, pay periods, earning/deduction types, categories (with conditional rendering based on category selections), and remarks. The bulk upload section allows users to upload a CSV file for adding multiple pay items at once.  The code utilizes Vuetify components extensively (v-dialog, v-btn, v-autocomplete, v-switch, v-radio-group, v-combobox, etc.) and imports `papaparse` (likely for CSV parsing) and `moment` (likely for date/time formatting).  There is no discernible pattern in the code changes beyond minor adjustments possibly related to bug fixes or minor UI refinements. The repeated timestamps suggest quick, successive modifications within a short timeframe.
