# Activity Summary for 28/05/2025

## 10:12:53
The log shows several code changes on May 28, 2025, focusing on a Vue.js application.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/pages/index.vue` file was updated at 09:12:51.  This update significantly revised the login page UI. Changes include adding an Outlook login option, implementing OTP verification, a create-new-password flow, and a forgot-password functionality.  The code uses Vuetify components extensively for styling and form elements.  Error handling with `v-alert` components is implemented for various scenarios (authentication failures, incorrect OTP, password mismatch).  The visual design incorporates images, customized styling, and responsive layout adjustments using Vuetify's `v-col` and `v-row` components.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/store/index.js` file was updated at 09:41:41. This update modified the Vuex store, primarily adding and adjusting functionalities related to user authentication, session management, and data persistence using `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies.  The store manages user roles (isAdmin, isSalAcc, etc.), token handling, and user profile information.  Encryption using CryptoJS is present in some areas (although the specifics of what data is being encrypted isn't entirely clear due to commented-out sections).  Several mutations are added to manage various aspects of user data and session status. Actions are included to handle user login, logout, session initialization (`nuxtServerInit`), and data persistence via `localStorage` and cookies, including setting user roles.  A notable feature is the handling of different user roles with corresponding cookie flags. Cookie values are parsed and used to populate Vuex state.  The  `setLang` mutation appears to always set the language to 'en' regardless of the input, which is inconsistent with the intended logic.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/nuxt.config.js` file was updated twice, at 09:43:02 and 09:43:12, with minimal differences between the two commits.  These updates configure the Nuxt.js application.  They specify various plugins (including Vuetify, Axios, authentication, i18n), define CSP (Content Security Policy) settings for enhanced security, and configure the Axios base URL and other settings based on environment variables pulled from a `config` file. The build configuration utilizes a webpack plugin to provide Lodash and Quill.js globally. The application uses a refresh token strategy for authentication. There's also a setup for internationalization using `@nuxtjs/i18n`.  The Helmet module adds several security headers to enhance HTTP security.


## 10:13:03
The log shows multiple updates to the `.env` file between 09:15:49 and 10:03:44 on May 28, 2025.  The primary change involves the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Initially, it contains commented-out options for different database connections (MongoDB).  The changes cycle through uncommenting different connection strings,  finally settling on  `DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://survitec-admin:aVJDGCXtV7ZLGaMi@clustera.lolh0.mongodb.net/survitec-prod` at 10:03:44.  Other environment variables remain largely consistent, indicating configuration for email services (SendGrid), authentication (JWT), AWS, and various API URLs.  There is no change in the values of the other environment variables throughout the log.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/helper/attendance_update_watcher.js` file at 09:19:34 contains code for monitoring attendance updates, updating remarks in the database, and sending late notification emails using AWS SES.  The code is extensively commented out, suggesting it might be under development or temporarily disabled.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/helper/user_update_watch.js` file at 09:19:48 includes code to monitor user and configuration updates, encrypting data using CryptoJS and storing it in Redis.  Again, much of this code is commented out.


The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-api/server.js` file at 09:20:00 shows a Node.js application using Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB), SendGrid, Socket.IO, and various other packages. It defines numerous API routes for different functionalities (loans, passports, claims, letters, etc.) and includes scheduled tasks (using `node-cron`) for various processes like events, quotes, expired documents, and client reports.  The file also imports the `user_update_watch` and `attendance_update_watcher` helper modules, suggesting integration with real-time data updates.
