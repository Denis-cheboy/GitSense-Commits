The log shows several code changes on May 28, 2025, focusing on a Vue.js application.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/pages/index.vue` file was updated at 09:12:51.  This update significantly revised the login page UI. Changes include adding an Outlook login option, implementing OTP verification, a create-new-password flow, and a forgot-password functionality.  The code uses Vuetify components extensively for styling and form elements.  Error handling with `v-alert` components is implemented for various scenarios (authentication failures, incorrect OTP, password mismatch).  The visual design incorporates images, customized styling, and responsive layout adjustments using Vuetify's `v-col` and `v-row` components.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/store/index.js` file was updated at 09:41:41. This update modified the Vuex store, primarily adding and adjusting functionalities related to user authentication, session management, and data persistence using `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies.  The store manages user roles (isAdmin, isSalAcc, etc.), token handling, and user profile information.  Encryption using CryptoJS is present in some areas (although the specifics of what data is being encrypted isn't entirely clear due to commented-out sections).  Several mutations are added to manage various aspects of user data and session status. Actions are included to handle user login, logout, session initialization (`nuxtServerInit`), and data persistence via `localStorage` and cookies, including setting user roles.  A notable feature is the handling of different user roles with corresponding cookie flags. Cookie values are parsed and used to populate Vuex state.  The  `setLang` mutation appears to always set the language to 'en' regardless of the input, which is inconsistent with the intended logic.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/survitec-admin/nuxt.config.js` file was updated twice, at 09:43:02 and 09:43:12, with minimal differences between the two commits.  These updates configure the Nuxt.js application.  They specify various plugins (including Vuetify, Axios, authentication, i18n), define CSP (Content Security Policy) settings for enhanced security, and configure the Axios base URL and other settings based on environment variables pulled from a `config` file. The build configuration utilizes a webpack plugin to provide Lodash and Quill.js globally. The application uses a refresh token strategy for authentication. There's also a setup for internationalization using `@nuxtjs/i18n`.  The Helmet module adds several security headers to enhance HTTP security.
