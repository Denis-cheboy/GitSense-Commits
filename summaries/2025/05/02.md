# Activity Summary for 02/05/2025

## 10:22:00
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/hitachi-gts-mcs-api/src/services/reports.service.js` file between 09:49:58 and 09:51:45 on February 5th, 2025.  All revisions contain the same core functionality: generating monthly reports that include employee data, document expiry information, and pending requests.  There are no substantial code changes between the revisions; the code remains consistent across all timestamps.

The `getMonthlyReportData` function is the core of the service. It fetches data from multiple models (`MonthlyReports`, `User`, `Requests`, `CoreConfig`) using aggregations to efficiently collect the required information.  The function calculates various metrics such as total employees, gender distribution, average contract tenure, employee turnover rate (comparing the previous and current months), and the number of pending requests categorized by type (claims, letters, leave, attendance, WFH).  Document expiry tracking is also incorporated, counting expired passports, Emirates IDs, visas, and insurance policies.  The data is aggregated and structured into a `newObj` which contains the generated report.

The consistent nature of the revisions suggests iterative debugging or minor adjustments rather than significant feature additions or refactoring.

The log shows updates to various environment variables, primarily related to database connections, API URLs, email configurations, and AWS credentials.  Significant changes are not individually timestamped within the provided log entry, only the overall update time of `02/05/2025, 10:52:08`.

The file `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/payroll-central-demo-api/.env` contains numerous environment variables.  These variables configure database connections for both payroll and a separate MobileEB system (using MongoDB).  Several API URLs are defined, pointing to services such as central API, ERP, notification microservice, and document generation services.  Email settings (SMTP details, sender addresses, and image URLs for email notifications) are also configured.  AWS credentials (access key, secret key, region, and bucket name) are included for what seems to be a cloud storage service.  Finally, there are variables related to JWT authentication (secret keys, expiration times) and a base URL for a payroll system.  There's a pattern of using multiple URLs for staging and possibly production environments based on the naming conventions.
