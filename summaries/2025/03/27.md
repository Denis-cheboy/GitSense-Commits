# Activity Summary for 27/03/2025

## 10:50:27
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/payslips/payslip.vue` between 09:50:28 and 09:54:14 on March 27, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve modifications to the `<script>` section.  Specifically, the `onMounted` lifecycle hook was added and refined across these changes. Initially, it was empty, then assigned values to data properties from `this.company_data`, and finally included a `console.log` statement to output `this.company_data`.  The template section remained largely unchanged, consistently displaying payslip information.

A separate file, `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue`, was updated at 10:50:07 and 10:50:16 on the same day.  These changes, however, appear minor and don't indicate substantial structural or functional alterations. The code in this file handles user authentication, payslip display and download functionalities. The changes made at 10:50:16 seem to be very insignificant or might be a re-render of the same code.  The file uses Vue.js components and integrates with Okta for authentication, offering both password-based and Okta-based login options.  It features a password input field, error handling for password mismatches, and a user interface for displaying and downloading payslips.  There is also decryption of URL parameters using CryptoJS before accessing the data.
