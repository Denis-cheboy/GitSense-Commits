# Activity Summary for 27/03/2025

## 10:50:27
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/components/payslips/payslip.vue` between 09:50:28 and 09:54:14 on March 27, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve modifications to the `<script>` section.  Specifically, the `onMounted` lifecycle hook was added and refined across these changes. Initially, it was empty, then assigned values to data properties from `this.company_data`, and finally included a `console.log` statement to output `this.company_data`.  The template section remained largely unchanged, consistently displaying payslip information.

A separate file, `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue`, was updated at 10:50:07 and 10:50:16 on the same day.  These changes, however, appear minor and don't indicate substantial structural or functional alterations. The code in this file handles user authentication, payslip display and download functionalities. The changes made at 10:50:16 seem to be very insignificant or might be a re-render of the same code.  The file uses Vue.js components and integrates with Okta for authentication, offering both password-based and Okta-based login options.  It features a password input field, error handling for password mismatches, and a user interface for displaying and downloading payslips.  There is also decryption of URL parameters using CryptoJS before accessing the data.


## 11:50:29
The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue` file underwent multiple revisions on March 27, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the  user interface and authentication flow for accessing and downloading payslips.

The initial changes (11:08:40, 11:12:02, 11:12:23) involved refining the visual presentation of the payslip list and preview sections. These updates didn't alter core functionality.  A notable change at 11:13:45 was the addition of a `console.log("plain",plain)` statement in the `beforeMount` lifecycle hook, suggesting debugging efforts related to the decryption of the route parameter `_id`.

Later modifications (11:20:58, 11:27:31, 11:49:15, 11:49:26, 11:49:45) involved commenting out `console.log` statements within the `validatePayslipUser` method. This indicates that logging related to password validation was deemed unnecessary or completed. The core functionality of the authentication and payslip display remained consistent throughout these revisions. The series of updates between 11:20:58 and 11:49:45 appears to be focused on minor code cleanup and refactoring, with no significant functional changes apparent.


The code consistently uses Vue.js components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, etc.) and incorporates features like password validation, Okta authentication, and payslip data decryption using CryptoJS.  The repeated edits suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the user experience and authentication process.


## 11:50:52
The provided code snippets show two nearly identical versions of a `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/users.js` file, with a timestamp difference of only 17 seconds between them (27/03/2025, 11:23:48 and 27/03/2025, 11:24:10).  The changes between the two versions are negligible, suggesting a possible accidental double-save or a very minor, undetectable edit.

The file itself is a Node.js Express.js API route handler for user-related functionalities.  It uses numerous libraries including `@sendgrid/mail`, `aws-sdk`, `@azure/msal-node`, `ioredis`, `moment-timezone`, `axios`, and `lodash`.  It interacts with several MongoDB models (`UsersModel`, `TokensModel`, `Logging`, etc.) and seems to handle user creation, authentication (potentially via Microsoft Azure), request processing (leaves, letters, WFH), and dashboard data retrieval.  The code includes functionalities for creating demo users, potentially making API calls to other services (`hrdirectapi-demo.devnhr.com`), and accessing external data sources.  There is also commented-out code related to authentication via Microsoft's MSAL library.  The code utilizes environment variables extensively for configuration, including database connection strings, API keys, and AWS credentials.


## 12:50:31
The log shows multiple revisions to two Vue.js component files: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue`.  The changes span a period from 11:55:08 to 12:38:17 on March 27, 2025.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue` underwent several revisions between 11:55:08 and 11:59:17, but the content remained largely the same. These minor revisions likely involved minor bug fixes or formatting adjustments as the code itself did not change significantly.  The component focuses on displaying payslips, allowing selection by employee or month, and includes features for searching and displaying payslip data.  There is a recurring pattern of using Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, etc.) for layout and display.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue` received more substantial updates between 12:09:03 and 12:38:17.  The initial version shows a payslip download page requiring password authentication, with an option for Okta login.  Subsequent revisions focus primarily on styling and layout improvements, suggesting iterative refinements to the user interface. The core functionality of displaying payslips and handling authentication seems consistent throughout these revisions.  The component uses CryptoJS for decryption of parameters received in the URL, suggesting a security measure to protect sensitive data.  The use of Okta for authentication is a recurring element, indicating a reliance on this service for user verification.  There's also the use of pagination for a better user experience when displaying many payslips.


## 12:50:58
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/users.js` file between 12:25 PM and 12:50 PM on March 27, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/users.js` file, with no apparent changes to other files in the log provided.

The code consistently uses various Node.js modules, including `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, `aws-sdk`, `ioredis`, `moment-timezone`, and `axios`, indicating a backend API handling user authentication, data interaction with a database (possibly MongoDB based on the use of `ObjectId` and `findOneAndUpdate`), and external service calls.  There's also integration with Azure via `@azure/msal-node` for authentication.

A significant portion of the code is related to a `/createDemoUser` endpoint. This endpoint creates two demo users (admin and employee) and optionally creates related requests (leave, letter, and WFH) to a separate HR system (`hrdirectapi-demo.devnhr.com`) via `axios` POST requests. The repeated structure in the `userUpdates` and `employeeUpdates` objects suggests a common reporting structure for approvals within the application. The commented-out `/test` route suggests an earlier implementation for handling Microsoft authentication, which was potentially replaced or refactored later.  A `/client-dashboards` route also exists, suggesting API calls to generate dashboards, likely aggregating data from the request system.

The frequent commits, spaced between 1 to 3 minutes, suggest iterative development and debugging, with minor modifications across revisions.  A notable change around 12:34 PM includes the addition of `PayslipsModel` which implies that payslip functionality was added to the application.  The final revision at 12:50 PM doesn't appear to introduce any substantial structural changes to the code,  but may reflect minor bug fixes or adjustments.


## 13:50:30
The log shows several revisions to the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/` project, specifically focusing on payslip display and download functionality.  The most significant changes occur between 13:19 and 13:27 on March 27, 2025.  These revisions involve substantial alterations to the `/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue` component.


Initially, `/pages/payslips/user/download/_id.vue` displays a password entry dialog, followed by a list of payslips and a preview.  The password validation uses encryption (CryptoJS) and  Okta authentication for specific company IDs. Payslip download uses a `downloadPDF_payslip` method, handling cases where the payslip URL might not be immediately available.  The code uses Vue.js components, notably `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, and `v-pagination` for layout and data display.


The changes between 13:19 and 13:27 significantly restructure the UI. The earlier version displays payslips in two columns: a list and a preview. The later version (13:26) shifts to a single-payslip-preview design for better mobile responsiveness, relying more heavily on visual components and styling.  The password dialog simplifies to a basic password entry and submission, dropping the Okta integration in this revision.  A crucial change is the introduction of bcrypt for password comparison, replacing a simpler comparison method.  The `getPayslips` method now employs CryptoJS.SHA256 for encryption and fetches data using `$axios.$post` requests. The code also retrieves user, configuration, and company data using similar encrypted post requests, making the data fetching more secure.  Further styling enhancements are made using scoped CSS to control the layout's responsiveness.


The `/components/payslips/payslip.vue` file is updated at 13:27, refining the payslip preview component. It now displays company logo, employee details, fixed and variable salary components and total net pay.


Finally, the `/pages/payslips/index.vue` component, updated at 13:42, introduces month-wise and employee-wise views for payslip management. It includes features like searching and filtering employees and payslips, downloading individual and bulk payslips, and sending bulk emails. This component is structurally very different than the download page, demonstrating clear separation of concerns in the codebase.  The page uses `v-autocomplete` for company selection and various Vuetify components for an improved user interface.

In summary, the codebase undergoes a refinement process improving security (bcrypt and CryptoJS),  UI/UX (responsive design), and functionality (bulk email, month-wise view), with a strong focus on payslip presentation and data retrieval.  The timestamped revisions clearly show an iterative development process.


## 13:50:56
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/users.js` and one update to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/payslips.js` between 12:52 PM and 13:18 PM on March 27, 2025.  The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/users.js` file underwent several minor revisions within a short time frame, suggesting iterative development or debugging.  The changes primarily focus on the `router.post('/createDemoUser', ...)` function, which appears to create demo users with associated requests (leaves, letters, WFH) by making calls to an external HR API (`hrdirectapi-demo.devnhr.com`).  This function is extensively modified throughout the log entries.  There's also a `router.post('/client-dashboards', ...)` function that aggregates request data, though this function remains largely unchanged across the log entries.  A commented-out section dealing with MSAL authentication is present but appears to be inactive.

The `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-api/api/payslips.js` file shows the addition of new API endpoints for managing payslips.  These endpoints provide functionality for retrieving payslip data based on various criteria (user ID, pay month, company ID), adding new payslips, and deleting existing ones.  The file uses `validateToken` middleware for authentication on many of its routes, except for one which uses `validateSecretKey` for a specific crypto-related operation. The timestamp for this file's update is 13:45:01 PM.  A pattern of consistent error handling with `try...catch` blocks is visible in both files.


## 15:53:18
The log shows multiple revisions to two Vue.js components: `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/user/download-payslips/_id.vue` and `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue`.  The changes span a short period on March 27th, 2025, between approximately 15:04 and 15:15.

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/user/download-payslips/_id.vue` underwent several revisions, but the code remains largely unchanged across these edits. The core functionality — displaying and downloading payslips after password verification — persists.  The key difference seems to be minor formatting and perhaps some debugging attempts, as there are no substantial structural or functional alterations.  The  `beforeMount` lifecycle hook consistently decrypts a parameter from the route using AES encryption with the key "@PC_*NATHAN!0*&".

`/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue` shows more significant changes across multiple commits. The component handles displaying payslips, both employee-wise and month-wise.  A recurring theme is the consistent use of the `services_general` plugin for various data manipulations (e.g., `getImage`, `getFixedSalaryConfig`, `variableSalaryConfig`, `getUserName`, `getUserDetails`).  The component also features a bulk email functionality for sending payslips.  The most noticeable changes are related to the organization and refinement of the UI, potentially improving the user experience and flow within the payslip management section.  Importantly, the `asyncData` method fetches data using an authentication token, suggesting server-side interaction for data retrieval.  The addition of `CryptoJS` in the final revision hints at potential future use of encryption within this component, though no actual encryption logic is currently present in the shown code snippets.


## 15:53:20
The log shows multiple updates to API routes for `/payslips`, `/users`, and `/configuration` on March 27, 2025.  The `/payslips` API underwent several revisions between 15:05:40 and 15:05:55, primarily adding and modifying various GET routes to retrieve payslip data based on different parameters (user ID, pay month, company ID). These routes primarily utilize the `PayslipsModel` for database queries and include error handling.  A POST route `/user/crypto-val/:_id` was added to retrieve payslips, requiring a secret key for validation.  Aggregate functions are also used in one POST route to calculate total additions and deductions. A POST route for adding new payslips and a DELETE route for deleting payslips are also present.

The `/users` API saw significant changes across multiple commits (15:06:45, 15:23:39, 15:26:26, 15:33:20, 15:42:05, 15:42:38, 15:46:40, 15:46:50, 15:50:06). These changes include adding a `/createDemoUser` route to create demo users with associated requests (leave, letter, WFH), enhancing the `/client-dashboards` route for data retrieval and adding routes for authentication using MSAL and for sending SMS and emails.  Extensive error handling is employed throughout the code.

The `/configuration` API (15:07:44, 15:15:55, 15:52:41)  was updated to include routes for retrieving configuration data, specifically `/get_conf_by_company/:_id` and  `/get-request-types`. A particularly complex POST route `/get-fields-check/all` checks the structure and data types of user data against predefined configurations, returning a detailed status report.  Update and retrieval routes use both direct queries and aggregations.

A recurring pattern is the use of `validateToken` middleware for authentication in many routes and the consistent use of `async/await` for database interactions.  Error handling with `try...catch` blocks is consistently implemented.  The use of `ObjectId` from Mongoose suggests the interaction with a MongoDB database.  Finally, the APIs make use of external services, like SendGrid for email and external APIs via `axios` calls.
