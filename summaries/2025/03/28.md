# Activity Summary for 28/03/2025

## 14:44:21
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/twosvn/eqs-platform-fe/src/auth/utils.js`.  The file contains two exported functions, `hasRequiredRole` and `hasModuleAccess`, which remain unchanged throughout the log. The primary focus of the modifications is a `usersToUpdate` array, which is a list of employee salary data.


Initially, the `usersToUpdate` array is declared but not used (around 13:17:23-13:17:45).  Subsequent changes between 13:18:07 and 13:22:39 demonstrate iterative attempts to update a database (`db.users`) using this array.  These updates involve using `forEach` to iterate over the `usersToUpdate` array and execute `db.users.updateOne` for each employee.

The `updateOne` operation progressively includes more salary fields (`basic_salary`, `transport_allowance`, `fixed_overtime`, `housing_allowance`, `other_allowance`, `telephone_allowance`, and `pension_plan_contribution`), handling potential `null` or `undefined` values by setting them to 0.  The final, successful update occurs at 13:22:39 and 13:24:24,  where the code correctly updates the `salary` nested field within the `users` collection.  There are minor syntax errors and incomplete code snippets in the intermediate updates (13:18:07, 13:18:17, 13:19:02, 13:19:17, 13:21:02, 13:21:39, 13:22:14, 13:22:21 and 13:22:31).
