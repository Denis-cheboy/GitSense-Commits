# Activity Summary for 28/03/2025

## 14:44:21
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/twosvn/eqs-platform-fe/src/auth/utils.js`.  The file contains two exported functions, `hasRequiredRole` and `hasModuleAccess`, which remain unchanged throughout the log. The primary focus of the modifications is a `usersToUpdate` array, which is a list of employee salary data.


Initially, the `usersToUpdate` array is declared but not used (around 13:17:23-13:17:45).  Subsequent changes between 13:18:07 and 13:22:39 demonstrate iterative attempts to update a database (`db.users`) using this array.  These updates involve using `forEach` to iterate over the `usersToUpdate` array and execute `db.users.updateOne` for each employee.

The `updateOne` operation progressively includes more salary fields (`basic_salary`, `transport_allowance`, `fixed_overtime`, `housing_allowance`, `other_allowance`, `telephone_allowance`, and `pension_plan_contribution`), handling potential `null` or `undefined` values by setting them to 0.  The final, successful update occurs at 13:22:39 and 13:24:24,  where the code correctly updates the `salary` nested field within the `users` collection.  There are minor syntax errors and incomplete code snippets in the intermediate updates (13:18:07, 13:18:17, 13:19:02, 13:19:17, 13:21:02, 13:21:39, 13:22:14, 13:22:21 and 13:22:31).


## 16:44:17
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/twosvn/eqs-platform-fe/src/auth/utils.js` file between 15:47:09 and 15:48:18 on March 28, 2025.  The core functionality of the file, which includes functions `hasRequiredRole` and `hasModuleAccess`, remained unchanged throughout all revisions.

The primary changes involve the `usersToUpdate` array and the subsequent update operation using it.  Initially, the array was declared with an extra `"Sheet1"` key.  This was subsequently removed.

The most significant change occurred in the final revision (15:48:18).  This revision added `"salary.total_fixed": user.total_fixed.toFixed(2) || 0` to the update operation, ensuring that the `total_fixed` value is updated in the database with two decimal places and handles cases where the value might be null or undefined.  The earlier revisions lacked this precision and error handling for `total_fixed`.  The `usersToUpdate` array itself contains data representing employee salary components (basic salary, allowances, overtime, etc.) and  `emp_id`  which is used to update the corresponding user's salary details in a database (`db.users`). The `emp_id` values appear to be a mix of numeric and alphanumeric identifiers.
