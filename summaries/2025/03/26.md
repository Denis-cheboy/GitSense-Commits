# Activity Summary for 26/03/2025

## 12:25:50
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file on March 26th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the UI for adding pay items, specifically enhancements to the "Add pay Item" dialog.

The initial changes (10:53:57 and 10:54:27) show the creation or significant restructuring of this dialog. It features three tabs: "Single Upload," "Bulk Upload," and "Digital Bulk Upload," each providing different methods for adding pay items.  The "Single Upload" tab allows for manual entry of employee details, pay period, type, category, amount, and remarks.  The "Bulk Upload" tab facilitates uploading pay items via a CSV file.  The "Digital Bulk Upload" tab presents a tabular view for adding multiple pay items.  These changes likely aim to improve user experience and efficiency in managing payroll.

Later revisions (11:33:27, 11:43:05, and 11:50:11) show no discernible code changes in the provided snippets.  The timestamps suggest that minor edits or adjustments might have been made, but the provided code remains consistent across these entries.  The lack of substantive change from 10:54:27 onwards implies potential debugging, minor UI tweaks, or other non-code-breaking modifications. The consistent nature of the code suggests that development focused on refining the existing structure rather than introducing new features during this period.

The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/payroll-central-admin/pages/users/index.vue` on March 26, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor adjustments and likely do not represent substantial functional alterations.  All revisions between 13:40:39 and 13:42:25  show identical code, suggesting potential issues with the logging mechanism or a series of near-identical, quickly-abandoned edits.  The final two edits at 13:48:56 and 13:49:04 and 13:49:42 also show identical code.

The `index.vue` file is a Vue.js component responsible for displaying a list of employees. The component includes features for adding new users, searching (basic and advanced), exporting data to Excel, and sending bulk emails. The advanced search allows filtering by various employee attributes including ID, status, name, email, designation, company, department, cost center, and date ranges for date of joining (DOJ) and last working date (LWD).  The employee list displays employee name, ID, designation, email, and department/team information.  There's also a section for displaying a selected employee's profile picture with an option to upload a new one.
