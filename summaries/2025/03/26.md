# Activity Summary for 26/03/2025

## 12:25:50
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/dennisabonda/Desktop/projects/alfalaval-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file on March 26th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the UI for adding pay items, specifically enhancements to the "Add pay Item" dialog.

The initial changes (10:53:57 and 10:54:27) show the creation or significant restructuring of this dialog. It features three tabs: "Single Upload," "Bulk Upload," and "Digital Bulk Upload," each providing different methods for adding pay items.  The "Single Upload" tab allows for manual entry of employee details, pay period, type, category, amount, and remarks.  The "Bulk Upload" tab facilitates uploading pay items via a CSV file.  The "Digital Bulk Upload" tab presents a tabular view for adding multiple pay items.  These changes likely aim to improve user experience and efficiency in managing payroll.

Later revisions (11:33:27, 11:43:05, and 11:50:11) show no discernible code changes in the provided snippets.  The timestamps suggest that minor edits or adjustments might have been made, but the provided code remains consistent across these entries.  The lack of substantive change from 10:54:27 onwards implies potential debugging, minor UI tweaks, or other non-code-breaking modifications. The consistent nature of the code suggests that development focused on refining the existing structure rather than introducing new features during this period.
